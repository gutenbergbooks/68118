<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The author wishes to state that the basis of the following courses
rests more upon the art or practice of teaching manual training than
upon the theory. It is the result of carefully prepared plans executed
under public school conditions by the author himself, covering a period
of some nine years of experimentation. Wherever plans, or theory,
were found producing results which common sense indicated plainly
were not for the pupils’ highest good, practical expediency supplanted
theory.</p>

<p>If manual training practice in the two upper grammar grades has
merited criticism it has been because school men have not taken its
subject matter seriously enough.</p>

<p>It is too much to hope that results can be achieved that are truly
educative, when a shop, however well equipped, is turned over to a
teacher but slightly experienced in, and appreciative of, the “finer points”
of the subject matter to be dealt with. Loose and unorganized efforts
in any line of work cannot become educative, it matters not what fine
spun theories may be offered as proof to the contrary. Indeed, much
positive injury may be done.</p>

<p>If the present demand for vocational training teaches manual training
anything, it is that the subject matter of manual training must
receive more serious attention. The aims of manual training and
vocational training, in one sense, are not so very different; both seek,
or should, to assist the boy to become a “thinking doer.” The distinction
is mainly a matter of “direction” and of allotment of time,
with possibly a slight difference in the placing of the emphasis on one
or the other of the words “thinking doer.”</p>

<p>We do not mean to imply that manual training and vocational training
are the same, but we do mean to say that the educative value of
any shop training, whether given from the point of view of general
culture or of special preparation for life’s work, is evidenced in the attitude
which pupils are allowed to assume toward their work. Incorrect
and slovenly habits of thinking and doing have no more place in manual<span class="pagenum" id="Page2">[2]</span>
training than in vocational training. Organization of subject matter
is as essential in manual training as in any other line of endeavor.</p>

<p>Among other things, it is the author’s hope that the book may offer
some suggestions that will help to bring about a better understanding
of the relation of the high school and grade school manual training.
The arrangement and division of the subject matter and the grouping
of the problems represent one method of attack.</p>

<p>The employment of skilled instructors in both grade and high school
and the making of the work of the upper grammar grades serious
mechanically rather than merely “expressional” will wait in many
communities upon the initiative of the school authorities.</p>

<p>Normal school students will find the outline representative of a
manual training practice that is being carried on in some schools that
are reputed to be progressive.</p>

<p>Finally, it is expected that the book will prove helpful to young instructors
in their first year of teaching, assisting them over many of the
petty details which spell success or failure in varying degree, which
otherwise would not be foreseen.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<h4 class="inline"><b>Foreword.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">It is assumed that woodworking and mechanical
drawing have subject matter and that it is desirable to have an orderly
arrangement. Such an assumption may seem unwarranted to some&mdash;to
those who labor in private institutions where the instruction is individual
or nearly so. It is believed, however, that to teachers of these subjects
in the public schools, where for economic reasons, classes of considerable
numbers must be cared for, the necessity for a careful selection and arrangement
of subject matter is very evident.</p>

<p>It has taken some years for the manual training movement to recover
from the extremes into which the late psychology and child study movement
had led it. The exaltation of the “individual” and the reign of the
“self-expressionist,” it would seem, is about over. Not that this latter
movement was an evil&mdash;far from it. Its influence was needed and came
none too soon. Like other great movements, however, it led some
teachers to extremes, causing them to overlook the good in the old with
the result that the new alone has proven no more desirable than the old
alone. The pendulum of opinion is returning and in not a few important
places, is already swinging to the other extreme. It is for
manual training teachers to try to determine by an exchange of ideas
where the sanest position lies.</p>

<p>In this discussion, we should ever keep in mind that the American
public school system is maintained mainly to prepare boys and girls for
good and useful citizenship; that this is a democracy in which neither
individual nor class is to be exalted unduly and that our system of
education must result neither in the chaos of anarchy nor in the dull
formalism of a despotism. To the writer it appears that manual training
as practiced before the psychologist took possession was quite typical of
the countries from which its influence came, Russia and Sweden-formalism.
Under the influence of the most radical of the psychologists,
manual training became synonymous with educational anarchy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span></p>

<p>The best American citizenship cannot be developed by means of either
the new alone or the old alone. There must be due attention paid to
the development of the individual but that same individual must learn
that he is but one of many and that he must do some things because
they make it possible for all to enjoy equal rights and privileges. With
this thought in mind, irrespective of any consideration of economic
advantages, orderly arrangement of subject matter and class instruction,
made necessary in large schools, must be looked upon as helpful rather
than harmful in the preparation of the individual for citizenship.</p>

<p>Superintendent L. D. Harvey has said:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>Members of society may be roughly classed into four groups: those who
think without doing; those who do without thinking; those who neither think
nor do; and those who think and do because of their thinking. This fourth
class comprise the productive, constructive, organizing element of society. It is
the function of the public schools to produce members of this fourth class. It
must be evident to all that for the production of a thinking and doing individual
the two forms of activity should be carried on side by side; the doing growing
out of the thinking, and the thinking made clear and definite thru the doing.</p>

</div><!--quote-->

<p>In this statement the writer sees the proper relation of those two
essential elements that make manual training valuable as a school subject&mdash;the
thought element and the element of skill. Manual training
suffered by having the one&mdash;skill&mdash;unduly emphasized when our
European importations were made. Recently, it has suffered by having
the other&mdash;the thought side&mdash;unduly magnified. Both of these elements
are important.</p>

<p>In the author’s experience the practical application of a system that
would make the most of each of these elements has been a source of no
little disappointment. Effort in one direction seemed always to result
in a sacrifice in the other. That is, when the thought side was emphasized
there was a falling off in the accuracy of the results. When skill
was magnified it was attained only with a sacrifice of the thought element.
With many misgivings the conclusion was reached that the
introduction of original thinking on the part of the pupil must mean
somewhat of a sacrifice on the skill side. Concerning this phase of the
subject Professor Richards writes:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>In order to develop in the highest degree independence of thought and power
of initiative the pupil must be given opportunities for determining ends and
working out means. Only in this way is the natural cycle of mental activities&mdash;thinking,
feeling and doing&mdash;fully realized and made effective. The practical<span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span>
realization of this principle means, of course, a distinct problem of instruction.
The problem is essentially one of proportion and balance between freedom of
expression on the one side and skill and mastery of process on the other. Extreme
emphasis on the one leads inevitably to a class of crude and ill-considered
products while attention restricted to the other results in mere drill and formalism.</p>

</div><!--quote-->

<p>Further, in “<span class="smcap">The Manual Training Teacher</span>,” Charles L. Binns,
an Englishman just returned from a trip thru the United States, writes
of manual training in the grades as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>The lack of exactness is the main defect of American manual training. But
there are many compensations to be balanced against this, and these arise
chiefly, in my opinion, from the fact that the teacher is allowed more liberty to
follow his own judgment in teaching the subject than is the case here. He has
more scope for exercising his initiative, with the result that he retains the
freshness of interest and enthusiasm for his work that our own stereotyped and
restricted schemes do much to quell. There is a fine spirit of free activity, eager
interest, and industry permeating most of the manual training classrooms. Even
the inferior work is done with a happy glow of achievement that half excuses
it. * * * To emphasize unduly the aim of rigid mechanical accuracy
generally means a sacrifice of the thought side of the work. Those qualities
which lead eventually to the realization of the pupil’s highest powers&mdash;such
qualities as intelligent self direction; an alert resourceful attitude of mind; and
power to plan means to an end&mdash;are too valuable to lose for such an aim.
* * * At the same time a system of handwork that ignores a reasonable
standard of accuracy does not count for much. In the course of my visits I
found more than once not only an almost entire disregard for exactness in the
work of the boys, but also an almost entire neglect on the teacher’s part to strive
for it. Something may be said for a method which grants the pupils liberty to
express themselves freely in their work, if the results are critically examined
and the errors pointed out, but to accept and pass complacently work manifestly
inferior is quite inexcusable. There is an element of haste about some of the
work which may account for some of this.</p>

</div><!--quote-->

<p>More recently Dr. Georg Kerschensteiner the eminent German
authority of Munich while on a tour of the United States is quoted by
the “<span class="smcap">Manual Training Magazine</span>” as criticising our manual training
strongly, saying:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>He could not see why children are encouraged to make big pieces of furniture
before they can square up a piece of wood properly or make a single joint of
the type that must be multiplied many times in the piece of furniture, if it is
properly constructed. From this statement it must not be concluded that his
pedagogy is of the dried out kind. On the contrary he stated with marked
emphasis that the first requisite in training for skill is to cultivate joy in work.
“It is in that way that we appeal to the heart,” and “it is only when the feelings
are brought into action that we can most truly educate.”</p>

</div><!--quote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span></p>

<p>We may conclude from this brief statement of the situation that it is
desirable to organize and have courses in our manual training and
mechanical drawing and that whatever system is adopted it must make
allowance for emphasis upon both the thought element and upon skill.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>What System Shall We Use.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">It is pretty generally conceded
that manual training as exemplified by the Russian system of joint
making and the Swedish system of model making fails to lead forth
the powers of the child to the fullest extent. The educational theory,
now generally accepted, that interest is the indispensable basis of every
method of education is sufficient to condemn the Russian system so far
as its application in non-technical schools is concerned, while Swedish
Sloyd, unmodified, is weak in that it fails to take into account the
reflective phase of interest, namely, the power of self-initiative. Extreme
“educational manual training’s” greatest weakness lies in its undue
emphasis upon the thought element resulting in too great sacrifice of
that other equally important element, skill or accuracy. The manual
training movement is to be congratulated in that all signs now seem to
point to its speedy delivery from the hands of these latter extremists.
Is it too much to hope that out of our past experiences with the joint
making Russian system with its admitted disciplinary value, the Swedish
model making with its effort to utilize the energy of the worker toward
useful products, and the self expression of the pedagogical movement
with its attendant elements of interest and initiative there may come a
manual training practice that shall be marked by a combination of the
best of these elements with a consequent elimination of the weaknesses
of each?</p>

<p>The outline of study suggested in the Illinois State Course of Study,
credit for which is due mainly to Professor Charles A. Bennett, the
chairman of the committee on manual training in woodwork, has proven
a source of very great help to the writer in his efforts to properly present
the subject matter of woodwork to his pupils. The introduction to this
course is well worth repeating and is in substance as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>Any course in woodworking worthy of a place in the eighth and ninth grades
of public school work should meet the following requirements:</p>

<p>1. It should arouse and hold the interest of the pupils.</p>

<p>2. Correct methods of handling tools should be taught so that good technique
may be acquired by the pupils.</p>

<p>3. Tool work should be accompanied by a study of materials and tools used<span class="pagenum" id="Page11">[11]</span>
in their relations to industry. Special attention should be given to the study
of trees&mdash;their growth, classification, characteristics and use.</p>

<p>4. Drawing should be studied in its relation to the work done.</p>

<p>5. The principles of construction in wood should be taught thru observation,
illustration and experience.</p>

<p>6. At least a few problems should be given which involve invention or
design or both, thereby stimulating individual initiative on the part of the pupils.</p>

<p>The course is arranged in groups, each group representing a type of work.
These groups are given in the order of procedure. The teacher is expected
to provide problems of the greatest value educationally. This means that the
things to be made should be worth making and that the process of making them
should be interesting to the student.</p>

<p>From this it follows that the things to be made must come to the pupil
in an order which gives reasonable consideration to the difficulties to be
encountered in making them.</p>

</div><!--quote-->

<p>Our outline will aim to present the work so as to meet the conditions
specified above. It has been thoroly tested over a period of years in
public school work. It follows the group plan. The advantages of the
group system are distinct. It permits class instruction and therefore
minimizes the amount of demonstrating and talking that the instructor
must do by preventing needless repetition. By grouping a number of
projects having similar tool operations it permits a boy to satisfy his
individual needs without interfering with the orderly presentation of the
subject matter. It provides work for the fast worker of an interesting
and profitable nature until the slow worker completes the minimum
requirement. It provides for the “repeater,” who often has to repeat,
not because of poor work in manual training but because of poor work
in academic studies, by giving him choice of different models upon which
to work. In general, the group plan possesses the manifest advantages
of class instruction at the same time making allowance for the individuality
of the worker.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Discussion of Woodwork Course.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Column one describes
the condition of the stock when given the pupil. Column two names
the new principles involved in the construction of the articles.</p>

<p>In Group I. stock mill-planed upon two surfaces to the thickness
wanted is given the pupil and he is required to square it up. No
definite dimensions are demanded but the class is given to understand that
the best workman is he who can square up his piece with the fewest
shavings removed. The gage is not used on this piece. The uniformity
of width is determined by the sliding try-square test. The broad surfaces
are not worked by the pupil at all in making this piece. In the first
place, the use to which the piece is to be put demands no fine surface
treatment. In the second place, experience shows that it is advisable to
make this first piece as simple as possible and pupils, at least grammar
school pupils, learn to handle the plane better on edge planing than on
surface planing.</p>

<p>An examination of the headings of the groups suggested for seventh
grade, and the directions given in connection with the problems will
show that each of these groups introduces a new method of squaring up
stock. For illustration, Group I is typical, as to the surface treatment,
of the method used by carpenters and others in preparing outside finishing
material such as cornice and window and door casings, corner boards,
etc. Here mill-marks are not considered objectionable so that neither
broad surface is worked. Group II is typical, as to the surface treatment,
of the method of preparing interior wood trim. One surface is
planed smooth, and straight as to its width, but no effort is made to take
out the wind, nor is the back surface treated at all. Again, certain kinds
of shelving and box construction require that both broad surfaces be
smoothed of their machine or mill-marks but do not require either surface
to be true, depending upon the manner of fastening the parts
together to take out any unevenness. Group V typifies this method of
treatment. Of course, if the stock is badly curled or cupped no attempt
is made to use it for the thickness for which it was originally intended,
tho it is possible to “nail out” pretty badly warped boards on certain
kinds of carpentry work. In furniture making this is hardly ever possible
or advisable. A sleeve pressing board does not require a face edge
or square ends, etc., Group IV. Group III typifies the standard treatment
of which these others are modifications.</p>

<p>In the third column tools necessary for performing the process are
named. In elementary woodwork the block-plane and smooth-plane may
be omitted, the jack-plane doing the work just as well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page17">[17]</span></p>

<p>In the <a href="#Page89">Lesson Outlines</a>, section numbers of a text on woodworking to
which the student is referred are given. The text to which the numbers
refer is “<i>Essentials of Woodworking</i>.” The necessity for a text to
accompany but not to take the place of the demonstration is well appreciated
by most teachers of manual training. With a text in the
hands of each pupil a lesson may be assigned and the pupil required to
familiarize himself with the text and the illustrations relating to the
subject matter. The use of a text removes most effectually the necessity
for a constant repetition of oral instruction. With a text there is never
any excuse for the pupil bothering the instructor with the otherwise
semi-valid excuse of “I forgot” or “I was absent when the demonstration
was given,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>In Groups VIII and IX will be found exercise pieces. One of the
advantages claimed for the group system is that it permits class instruction
at stated intervals, thus reducing individual instruction to a minimum.
For illustration, a class beginning Group II would continue to
work upon the problems of that group until all but the few acknowledged
failures had completed the work required in that group. After
this the class is to be instructed in the new things of Group III. This
plan to continue thruout the whole course.</p>

<p>The work of the groups will of necessity overlap each other. For,
as soon as a pupil finishes one problem in a group, he begins another
problem in the same group, unless he is the slowest in the class. When
the class is ready to begin a new group we are confronted with the
question of whether to give the instruction belonging to the new group
and allow the boys to proceed with the unfinished work of the old
group, or to start them on problems of the new group. To proceed
with the old is objectionable in that the worker forgets his new instruction
before he has opportunity to apply it. To start new work
before finishing the old is bad in that the pupil will have lost interest in
the old when asked to complete it after finishing the new work. Not
to complete the old at all would be a practice too vicious to be tolerated
for a moment.</p>

<p>In the seventh grade this overlapping is not a serious problem, for the
objects being small and quickly finished allow all to finish the old group
before the instruction of the new has faded. In the eighth grade and
high school, however, where the objects are larger, this objection is a
serious one.</p>

<p>As stated before, the aim of the group arrangement is to permit class<span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span>
instruction at the beginning of each group. To make this effective the
practice and application must follow within a reasonably short time.
Here the “exercise” offers aid.</p>

<p>If ever an exercise piece has a legitimate use, it has it here. The
great objection to exercise pieces lies in their inability to create a vital
interest on the part of the pupil. The writer has made it a practice to
talk over the applications of each exercise and to state briefly the need
for the exercise before beginning it. First, that the class because of
numbers must be instructed all at the same time; second, that the joints,
unlike the simple one-piece objects previously made cannot be remedied
or patched up by reducing the size, as in the bread board, when lack of
knowledge or skill causes errors; third, that postponing the practice any
length of time would be unwise. As the time required for making the
exercises, as arranged in the course outlined above, is short there has
never been a lack of interest either in the exercise or in the unfinished
objects of the old group to which some must return after completing
the exercise.</p>

<p>High school boys begin to take on a different attitude toward exercises
and technique. Their increased knowledge and skill permit applications
requiring considerable time for completing. For this reason
all the exercises are grouped in the fore part of their year.</p>

<p>To the writer it seems unnecessary to apologize for this use of exercises.
He has felt free to utilize parts of any system which seemed to
serve his purpose. He does feel, however, that a long continued series
of exercises in elementary woodworking without application would be
fatal. American school methods have been criticised by Europeans as
being superficial and lacking in thoroness. It may be that in our eagerness
to develop the individual we have made ourselves subjects for such
criticism to a certain extent. We need not fear the introduction of this
small amount of drill and formalism, especially when there is no loss
of interest or incentive. It is impossible to teach a pupil a thing that is
entirely new to him unless he has in his possession a fund of “known”
thru which the unknown may be made known. For this reason drawings
and sketches are plentifully provided.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that better results are obtained, both in the
development of ability to think and ability to do, if the ability to “do”
is given a maximum of attention at the beginning of the course, opportunities
for original thinking being introduced gradually as the pupils’
knowledge, appreciation, and skill increase. In the beginning groups the<span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span>
sizes or dimensions are fixed, no variation being permitted except as poor
work necessitates. Requiring all to make the same pieces in the beginning
groups permits comparison of results and the establishing of
standards of accuracy as well as making it possible to give definite instruction
with the minimum of talking.</p>

<p>Another reason for emphasizing technique and processes at the beginning
is that interest is so easily directed. A beginner is interested in
anything. In fact, a few exercises&mdash;not more than two or three&mdash;might
be introduced at the very beginning without in any way violating the
principle relating to interest previously mentioned. The writer does
not make use of exercises in this way but can understand some of the
advantages secured by so doing.</p>

<p>Having taught the pupil to respect a “working line,” which experience
shows takes the greater part of the seventh year, it will be time to begin
to encourage original thinking on the part of the pupil. This, because
of the pupil’s ignorance of the subject matter, will come slowly, if satisfactorily.
Modifications of the dimensions of the projects should be the
first step. While originality is to be encouraged in every way it should
never be forced at the expense of appreciation. Appreciation must be
developed first. Better a chair of good design and proportion made
after another’s design with appreciation than an absurdity made after
one’s own design and its weaknesses not seen. The greatest value of
design in public school education is expressed well by Professor Sargent
when he says, “For one who will produce a design, a thousand must
know how to select it.”</p>

<p>Pupils possessed of exceptional originality and ability will find ample
opportunity for expression in the group system without hindrance upon
the part of the slower neighbors and without requiring all the instructor’s
time at a sacrifice of the time which the slower pupils have a right to.
The slow pupil has a right to an equal share of the instructor’s time,
and this is not always easy to give when the brilliant pupil is to be
given individual and advanced instruction as the systems other than the
group system necessitate.</p>

<p>In general, it will be found advisable to hold seventh grade pupils
quite rigidly to the execution of the projects offered. In the eighth grade
pupils should be encouraged to modify existing projects, while in high
school they should be encouraged to “work up” original ideas. By this
time they should have acquired a fair fund of information and some
judgment and appreciation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span></p>

<p>A glance at the outline on woodworking will show that the projects
in eighth grade and in high school are most all of such a nature as to
demand considerable repetition of processes. For illustration, in the
making of the taboret there are eight dado joints. We have heard so
much of the non-educational value of repeated processes that one may be
inclined to question the arrangement of a course which introduces but
two joints in the course of a year’s work, as is done in the eighth grade
of this outline. In view of the fact that very many courses introduce
the glue joint, mortise-and-tenon, etc., in the eighth grade it may be well
for the writer to state his point of view. It is this: The highest
educational value comes not from many joints put to the pupil in such
rapid succession that he has not time for the acquirement of a fair
degree of proficiency, but rather from the mastery of a few by repetition
so planned as to maintain a keen interest in each joint made. As a
recent writer has said, “There is need for more investigation on the point
that repeated processes are non-educational. Doing certain things until
the process becomes automatic sometimes leads one to take the first step
toward a higher freedom.” This, in view of the present demands of
industrial education, is the excuse for offering a few joints well made
rather than many joints with the consequent mechanical indigestion that
usually follows. As soon as the process has become fairly automatic,
or when the joint has been fairly well mastered, then are we ready to
proceed to new fields. In the seventh grade outline the introduction of
new processes is more frequent. This is due to the fact that the
operations are simple and of such a nature, planing for example, that
future work necessitates their frequent repetition.</p>

<p>The accurate use of the chisel is kept until the eighth grade, as is also
accurate sawing to a knife line with the back-saw. It has taken us a
long time to come to a realization that, while the chisel and saw are
simple tools, their proper handling is not simple. A general survey of
the groups for grade seven will show that each is concerned with one of
the various type processes used in squaring up stock, both mill-planed
and rough. In eighth grade the groups are concerned with the accurate
use of the chisel and back-saw in chiseling, or paring, and sawing to fit.</p>

<p>In Group IX, which is the first year high school work, the pupil may
be expected to give most of his attention to the principles of simple
joinery of board and framed structures with the necessary joints. A
full set of individual edged tools should give the instructor excuse for
demanding a much higher degree of technique than is to be found in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span>
grades. The pupils will not be perfected in the use of the chisel, saw,
and other tools but they should have acquired enough skill to enable them
to proceed with the work of the mortise and tenon.</p>

<p>Exercise pieces in mortise-and-tenons, miter, modeling and glue joint
belong here. It is possible to arrange the work so that the modeling
and glue joint exercise pieces may be considered under Application. The
modeling exercise may well be a hammer handle, the metal part of which
is to be worked in the metal class the other half of the first year. The
glue joint may well be made upon wood of sufficient size that it may be
used later, such as the taboret top. The mortise-and-tenon and miter,
however, will be most profitable as exercises pure and simple. A
moment’s thought will indicate the reason for making the distinction.</p>

<p>Many courses give modeling in the grades. Modeling to be of value
requires judgment and experience. This a grade pupil has not. The
first year high school is sufficiently early for this kind of work. To place
it earlier is to give the pupil a wrong impression of the requirements of
good modeling, and his later work, in pattern-making for example,
suffers accordingly.</p>

<p>Two machines should be made use of in the first year high school
work, the band-saw and scroll or jig-saw. Both, when properly safeguarded,
are well suited to give the pupil his first acquaintance with
machinery. There is little educational value in further excessive ripping
by hand at this stage of the course.</p>

<p>The cabinet-making course is not to be considered as manual training
<i>per se</i>. It is best to make it optional and more purely a trade course, tho
the work may still be individual in its nature. An exercise in making a
small door and one in the making of a drawer will introduce the student
to the use of most of the machinery specified. These exercises should
be detailed so as to involve stock of the same size for each boy. In this
way the machines may be set and all the parts of similar kind run thru.
Classes of considerable size may be taught with the use of the minimum
of machinery. Each boy should, of course, be taught the setting of the
various machines.</p>

<p>After these two exercises, with hinging and locking, the pupils may be
allowed to work out pieces of their own choosing involving these
elements, preparing their own stock, setting their machines, etc. In this
way the “shop” practice, quantity or piece work, is obtained in the
making of the exercises while the application later allows for the individuality
of the pupil.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Discussion of Drawing Course.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The course in mechanical
drawing, like that in woodworking, is arranged in groups according to
the principles to be developed. The arguments for the group system in
woodworking apply equally to the group system in mechanical drawing.</p>

<p>There has been an aim to correlate the woodworking and mechanical
drawing just as far as the logical presentation of each would allow.
From the concrete and near by to the more general has been the guiding
principle in laying out the course in mechanical drawing as well as in
woodwork. For this reason the seventh grade problems in woodwork
have been utilized to introduce the elementary principles in mechanical
drawing. Even as the pupils of our primary schools learn to read
without being conscious of the “dry bones” of language and spelling
back of it, so, in the teaching of mechanical drawing, the aim is to
arouse in the beginner an interest in the ability to draw and to read
drawings, as an accomplishment, and to inspire him to work, because
he sees that there is something he needs, wants, and must have.</p>

<p>Little or no effort is made in seventh grade drawing to develop
originality. Almost all effort is spent in developing a drawing technique
and a good style. Most all of the pupils’ drawings are made with plates
before them. These they copy, using a different scale, however. To
encourage the pupils to establish a high standard these drawings have
been inked by a draftsman selected because of his excellence in this line
of work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span></p>

<p>The drawing of the grammar schools in most places is best taught by
the instructor in woodwork. Extreme care should be taken to see that
the pupils are given the correct method of attack in making a drawing.
They should be made to follow this instruction just as conscientiously as
they are required to attempt correct execution in woodwork. In drawing,
as in woodwork, slovenly habits come handier to some pupils, and,
if allowed to become fixed, they will cause sorrow to the pupil and misunderstanding
later on. In the very first drawing, for example, and all
others, insist on having lightly penciled blocking out lines of indefinite
length&mdash;lines that are just visible, that is all. Do not allow the pupil
to form the habit of drawing a heavy line between two points previously
located. It is needless to say that the pencil must be of good lead,
properly sharpened, and kept sharp. It is an excellent plan to insist that
all construction or blocking out lines be left just as originally drawn, no
eraser being used at all. If lightly made, as they should be, they will
be inconspicuous in the finished drawing. They will be proof positive
that the method of procedure has been the correct one, will save the
pupil’s time, and give him a lightness of touch that will come in to
excellent advantage later on. After the drawing has been laid out in
light lines and inspected by the teacher, the lines that represent outlines
of the object can be gone over a second time and made to stand out.</p>

<p>By the close of the seventh grade a boy ought to be able to read and to
construct simple working drawings of three views properly related. He
will have had all of the simple conventions and should know them by
name with their meanings. While inking is not given a place in either
seventh or eighth grade, the drawings should show a good finish in
penciling and there should be no habits formed that will have to be
overcome later.</p>

<p>In eighth grade mechanical drawing, the first four groups review the
principles introduced in the seventh grade. They are in the form of
problems to be solved, however, and thus necessitate thought on the part
of the pupil.</p>

<p>In the solving of these problems a carefully made freehand, dimensioned
working drawing is first required. This, when correct, is
followed with a mechanical drawing, full size and without dimensions.
It will be noted that no attempt has been made heretofore to have the
pupils make freehand working drawings or sketches. It has been the
author’s experience that better results are obtained by introducing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
freehand drawings after the pupil has been taught and has had experience
in the exactness of the mechanical drawing.</p>

<p>The working drawings of this grade introduce no new principles
but give opportunity for practice in more difficult combinations of
elements. They provide opportunity for acquiring greater facility in
handling the instruments which results in drawings that are to be used
in the shops. While the drawings are copied from plates, as in the
seventh grade, the pupil is permitted to modify the designs within certain
limitations, with one problem in original design, structural and
decorative.</p>

<p>In high school drawing more time is allowed and the drawing becomes
more of a subject in itself, requiring more and deeper thought on
the part of the pupil. The high school drawing course is complete in
itself. The first four groups are given mainly as problems in inking
but they furnish a review of that part of the eighth grade drawing
incidentally. They also furnish a familiar starting point for the high
school work and make of the high school course a complete whole. High
school drawing is best given by a specialist.</p>

<p>As in the eighth grade, these problems are to be solved and drawn
freehand with dimensions. Afterward they are drawn mechanically and
inked. The inking of problems is specified in only the first four groups
in the outline for drawing. The amount of inking to be done thereafter
will best be determined by the instructor. Too much inking has a
tendency to result in careless penciling. It is for the instructor to
determine when his class is doing its best in both penciling and inking.
The problems of these latter groups are well calculated to necessitate
thought and study and the instructor will do well to make much of
this part of the subject.</p>

<p>The making of high school working drawings is placed early in the
course that they may be ready to use in the shop by the time the
exercises in joint work preparatory to their application, are completed.
These working drawings are to be original as far as possible. Plates
of suitable projects are to be provided to give the necessary starting
points.</p>

SHOP ORGANIZATION</h3>

</div><!--chapter-->

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec1"><b>1. Location of Shops.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Shops for high school pupils will be
located in or near the high school building. A special effort should be
made to have both wood shop and drawing room placed in suitable
environment. Where manual training has been introduced into high
schools with buildings planned for academic work only, it has been the
custom to place manual training in the basement and drawing in the
attic, these being the only places available for subjects that had yet to
prove their worth. Even today, when it is a well established fact that
handwork as a part of our educational course has not only proven its
worth but is prophesied a greater place in our educational scheme in
the form of industrial training, some school authorities not only place
shops in basements of old buildings but plan new buildings with basement
shops. This is an economy with nothing to justify it but tradition.</p>

<p>In many cities the custom of building basements high out of the
ground serves to mitigate some of the evils, by giving a fair degree of
light and ventilation. Any basement, however, that is formed with a
cement floor directly on the ground will be damp in the spring and fall
when the heating apparatus ceases to force warm air thru the rooms.
The result upon tools, upon wood, and upon the health of those who
must spend their time in such surroundings is not a matter of speculation.</p>

<p>Any subject to be taught to the best advantage must not only be a
subject that will win the respect of the pupils but it must be given
surroundings that will not tend to degrade it in the eyes of the immature
student. Excellent work has been done in basement rooms and excellent
discipline maintained under very adverse conditions but it has been in
spite of these conditions and not because they do not influence the student
unfavorably. In spite of the instructor’s best efforts to create a feeling
of respect toward the basement shopwork similar to that entertained
toward the academic work, pupils in going from the comfortably furnished
rooms above, in which the decorator’s art has helped to make
everything agreeable to the eye, unconsciously assume an attitude in their
first conduct and deportment that places the shop instructor at a disadvantage.</p>

ARRANGEMENT OF HIGH SCHOOL SHOP WITH REFERENCE
TO MAIN BUILDING.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span></p>

<p>The chief objection, aside from cost, to placing shops above ground
is the noise. This objection has been met, and can easily be met by any
competent architect. The accompanying floor plans are indicative. <a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>In some high schools, the shops are entirely separated from the main
or academic classrooms. This is unsatisfactory, as any one familiar with
high school organization knows. The frequent change of classes after
short periods makes the going from one building to another a matter of
serious moment, especially in our northern winter climate.</p>

<p>Shopwork has won its place fairly in our school courses and it is
encouraging to note an increasing tendency on the part of progressive
communities to place shop and drafting-room in environment calculated
to create a feeling of respect, to give dignity equal to that of other school
subjects, and to provide favorable conditions for the best working of
materials.</p>

<p>In the grammar schools the problem is but slightly different. In a
city of any size, shopwork will need to be given in centers. The
alternative of a shop in each school with an instructor going from shop
to shop on different days of the week is hardly practicable. The equipment
of a shop is a matter of too great cost to have it lying idle part of
the school time. There is added disadvantage in that a peripatetic shop
instructor cannot “keep up” his several shops with divided interest as
well as he can keep up one in which he works constantly.</p>

<p>The best plan is to have a center or shop located favorably for several
neighboring schools and install an instructor in this center. The pupils
are to be sent to him from a sufficient number of schools to occupy his
entire time at this shop.</p>

<p>Here again the basement makes its appeal to school authorities first,
the basement of some one of the grammar schools being utilized for a
shop center. Since almost all of the pupils come from other schools,
there is no excuse, other than economy, in placing grammar school
manual training shops in basements of schools already established. If
the high school shopwork suffers a disadvantage by being placed in basement
rooms, grammar school shopwork suffers more, and with less
excuse.</p>

<p>Since domestic science cannot well be taught in basements, and is
objectionable on main floors because of noise and odors, and since there
is no reason for having the laboratories directly connected with any
grammar school building, the best plan is to erect a special building to
house both manual training and domestic science. The cost need not be
great and the building may be erected upon grounds of some one of the
grammar schools. Evanston, Illinois, public schools offer a good illustration.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span></p>

<p>The proper placing of centers in a community will depend upon the
number of pupils to be cared for, the distance they must travel to get to
the center, and the site available.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec2"><b>2. Division or Allotment of Time.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Two divisions of time
are common in grammar school shopwork, the one-fourth and the one-half
day period once a week. In some cities manual training is given in
sixth, seventh and eighth grades of the grammar schools. In others it
is given in seventh and eighth grades only. In the former case, to the
best of the author’s information, the period never exceeds one-fourth day
each week. In the latter it very frequently occupies one-half day a
week. The outline for drawing and manual training as given in this
book presupposes the one-half day period. In favor of this period of
time are the following: The pupils go and come to manual training on
time out of school hours. This is a very decided gain and permits the
placing of centers so as to accommodate schools of widely differing
locations. Second, more and better work is accomplished in a one-half
day period of one year than in a one-fourth day period for two years.
In the one-fourth day period the pupil hardly gets his tools set and
adjusted when the bell signals him to begin to “clean up,” resulting in
much unprofitable effort. Our college administrators, who are responsible
for originating the short and infrequent period spread over a
long period of months or years, have long since found that better work
and more of it is obtained where the study is given a more intensive
view, the total number of hours for the course remaining the same but
being condensed into less calendar time.</p>

<p>The chief objection offered against the one-half day period is that the
pupil becomes tired, exhausted, and therefore disinterested and troublesome
before the close of the period. Where the full two hours and a half
are devoted entirely to shopwork, especially if the shopwork is of such a
nature as to make little appeal to the interest of the pupil, this argument
is valid. If, however, each period has its recitation on assigned study
and its demonstration on the new work to be presented there remains
but two hours of work requiring the student to be on his feet and, if
the interest is what it should be, very few boys will complain of fatigue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
The writer makes it a custom to give, in the place of the conventional
recess, a short five minute rest period. Boys are permitted to talk and
move about the shop but he has found that as many boys prefer to
continue their woodwork as prefer to rest.</p>

<p>If the one-fourth day period is to be used, it will be necessary to give
recitations and demonstrations on alternate days, and will necessitate
introducing the work lower than the seventh grade. It is hardly
profitable to begin serious, systematic work lower than the seventh grade,
and when it is begun in seventh grade it is hardly possible to make it
serious with a time allotment of less than one-half day each week.</p>

<p>There is not the same need for recess in shopwork as in academic
work. A five minute rest period is sufficient to permit pupils to make
known to each other their wishes or information. In this way it is
possible to dismiss the pupils ten minutes earlier than they otherwise
would be, thus allowing the morning class extra time for reaching home.</p>

<p>In the high school the time allotment is generally permitted to be
governed by the periods arranged for the academic subjects. The
common arrangement is to give two consecutive periods equal to two of
the recitation periods of the academic subjects for shopwork and another
for drawing each day thruout the week. If the periods are one hour
each, which is unusual in high schools tho common in colleges, but one
period is given to the shop.</p>

<p>Where manual training has been given serious consideration in the
seventh and eighth grades of the grammar schools under competent instructors
it ought to be possible to cover the necessary benchwork in
wood in the first half of the freshman year of the high school. This will
leave the second half for turning or for benchwork in metal, preferably
the latter.</p>

<p>To mechanical drawing the first half of the freshman year of one
period each day should be devoted, followed in the second half by freehand
drawing, perspective and design.</p>

<p>The mechanical drawing of the grammar schools, it will be noted in
the lesson outlines, takes the first twelve weeks or lessons of each year.
Mechanical drawing in grammar schools is usually presented in one of
three ways. First, by having the pupil make his drawing then immediately
make the object drawn in wood, carrying on woodwork and
drawing side by side thruout the year. Second, by having the pupil
make the object in wood first, followed by the drawing. Third, by
taking the first ten or twelve weeks of the year for making up all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
drawings of that year, following this with a continuous application in
wood.</p>

<p>After experimenting thru a number of years the writer finds the third
practice possesses many marked advantages. Among other things that
make it more satisfactory are the following: It permits concentration
of the pupil’s attention upon one thing at a time. Where woodwork
and drawing are carried on side by side or even where they alternate
the pupil’s attention and interest are divided. So much more interesting
do the pupils find the woodwork with its freer activity that the drawing
suffers immeasurably, it being almost impossible to get anything like the
proper attitude toward the technique of drawing when the young pupil
is allowed to see the immediate application in wood all around him.
The instructor’s struggles for neatness and accuracy in the drawings are
no match for the barbarous haste of the beginner in his desire to get
thru with the drawing and get at the woodwork. It is impossible to
get concentration on drawing in a woodshop with tools all about and
the knowledge on the part of the pupil that only the drawing separates
him from the tools.</p>

<p>The ideal way would be to have a separate drawing-room and equipment
as in high school. This, however, is impracticable in most grammar
schools. The woodworking teacher being the drawing teacher makes it
impossible to utilize both shop and separate drawing-room to advantage.
The fitting up and heating of rooms that are to be used only part of
the school time makes a separate drawing-room an unwarranted expense
in grade schools. A satisfactory substitute is to utilize the woodshop
benches for drawing benches but to remove all tools, having it distinctly
understood that ten or twelve weeks are for drawing, and that, no matter
how many drawings are produced by a pupil, he will begin no woodwork
until the time allotted to drawing is up. It becomes possible to secure
the right attitude toward the drawing. By this concentration of attention
both drawing and woodwork are the gainers.</p>

<p>Second, it enables the shop instructor to tell what supplies are going
to be needed for the woodwork and to get them delivered in time without
returning from his summer’s vacation several weeks before school begins.
In the twelve weeks of drawing the woodworking tools and equipment
can be looked over and put in order in plenty of time without breaking
into the summer months that belong to the instructor. Where the
woodwork begins at the beginning of school in September the instructor
must either take the fore part of his vacation at the close of school to<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
put his tools in shape or, if he has them simply cleaned and vaselined
by the pupils and stores them for the summer, he must come back several
weeks before school. This is true whether he does his own sharpening
or has it done, and the advantage in having woodwork begin some weeks
later than school is very manifest.</p>

<p>Third, this latter arrangement gives the pupil an intelligent preview
of the whole year’s work in wood thru the drawings he makes in the
first ten or twelve weeks.</p>

<p>Mechanical drawing, even in the grades, has a right to a clean,
quiet, well lighted room without unnecessary distractions either to the
eye or ear. This, with a definite understanding on the pupil’s part that
drawing technique is the major and the utility of the drawing the minor
consideration, should put the pupil in the right attitude toward his
drawing work and make it possible to secure the best drawings he is
capable of producing. No one, not even a finished draftsman, could
produce good drawings surrounded by the noise and dust of neighboring
woodworkers. Under the alternating system there are always slow
pupils who, if they finish their drawings before they make the application,
must do it while the others are working in wood. Add to the noise and
dust this pupil’s feeling that he too ought to be at his woodwork and
the limit of unfavorable conditions for producing a drawing are reached.
Making the year’s drawings the first twelve weeks of the year enables
one to avoid these unfavorable conditions.</p>

<p>Fourth, this arrangement makes possible a graduated transition from
the quietness and restrictedness of the academic class room to the noise
and greater freedom of the woodshop.</p>

<p>When beginning pupils come to the grammar school manual training
shop for the first time at the beginning of school in September, it is with
an overplus of energy and noise. To reduce these sufficiently to permit
of getting anything like satisfactory results in shopwork, the instructor
is placed at once squarely before a large problem in discipline. This
problem is very greatly simplified by introducing the pupil to ten or
twelve weeks or lessons in mechanical drawing before beginning the
woodwork.</p>

<p>Conditions surrounding a pupil in mechanical drawing classes are
very similar to those he finds in his regular academic classes and he can
readily be brought to understand that quietness, and orderliness with
seriousness of purpose are as necessary a part of his manual training as
of his academic work. After this attitude has been fixed in the pupil’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
mind in connection with his manual training thru the mechanical
drawing when the transition to woodwork is made, where more freedom
must be allowed, the pupil will be better able to distinguish between
legitimate noise and noise that is entirely unnecessary, and between
freedom and license.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec3"><b>3. Informational and Related Matter Pertaining to
Woodwork and Mechanical Drawing.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Closely related to any
subject is a vast fund of informational matter. If the student is to have
an intelligent understanding of the subject matter, he must be given
opportunity to become acquainted with at least the most important of
this related information.</p>

<p>In the seventh grade the necessary study of tools and processes occupies
the pupil’s time fully. In the eighth grade opportunity offers itself for
introducing such subjects as wood structure, tree growth, lumbering,
and milling. In high school, the pupil should be made familiar with the
most common woods, their classification, characteristics, and uses.</p>

<p>High school pupils should be assigned outside readings on forestry.
They should secure and classify specimens of the more common woods
and should be able to recognize the tree by leaf, fruit, bark, wood and
tree form. See Figs. 4, 5, and 6.</p>

<p>In the grammar grades, mounted specimens should be prepared illustrative
of tree structure, shrinkage, defects, etc. As in the high school,
pupils should be encouraged to seek and prepare specimens illustrative of
the subjects under consideration.</p>

<p>It is now possible to rent or purchase very excellent lantern slides on
forestry, lumbering, milling, etc. Add the use of these to that of the
mounted specimens if at all possible.</p>

<p>The detailed lesson outlines indicate definitely where these subjects
are to be given attention in the course. The pages of the text are also
indicated. The high school library should be provided with the very
excellent bulletins of the United States Department of Agriculture,
Division of Forestry, most of which are for free distribution.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec4"><b>4. Woodfinishing.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The subject of woodfinishing is treated in
a manner quite similar to that of woodworking. No pieces of woodwork
that should have a finish are ever sent from the shop until they have
been treated to a finish calculated to make them fit for immediate placing
in their future surroundings.</p>

<p>While the general outline of the course in woodwork makes no mention
of woodfinishing, the lesson outline indicates the gradual introduction<span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span>
of the subject, beginning with the simplest finishes first and
terminating in high school in the rubbed copal varnishes.</p>

<p>In woodfinishing, as in woodworking, the aim has been to have the
pupil treat the subject in a serious and workmanlike manner. In
seventh grade little woodfinishing is done. The woodworking processes
need the centering of the pupil’s attention, in the first place. Second,<span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span>
the simple pieces which the beginner is able to make require no finish
as a rule. In one group stain and wax is used. This is the group
in which decorative design is emphasized. In the eighth grade the
woodfinishing problem becomes important. Almost all of the pieces
require a finish.</p>

<p>The greatest obstacle to proper woodfinishing lies in the desire of the
pupil to take his piece home as soon as the woodwork is completed.
Unless a definite understanding is had with the class beforehand, proper
woodfinishing is difficult to obtain. Most boys are subject to reason, so
that it is not at all necessary to have woodfinishing slighted or to resort
to makeshifts. The writer makes it a practice to take plenty of time<span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span>
when the subject of woodfinishing comes up for its first discussion to
explain in detail the commercial methods of finishing fine furniture, a
piano for illustration, counting the different operations and coatings it
will receive and the labor and time expended upon the finish. A comparison
is then made between a finely rubbed finish and the cheap, sticky,
unrubbed finishes of cheap furniture.</p>

<p>Having established in the minds of the pupils the fact that woodfinishing
is an art second to none and that it requires time to do it well,
there is not that impatience that breeds sullen looks when the woodfinishing
is to be begun after the woodwork has been completed. The
pupil will take the woodfinishing as a matter of course and goes about it
in a cheerful and manly spirit.</p>

<p>In grammar schools, woodfinishing has been made as simple as is
consistent with good work. Coming as the boys do but once a week and
each finishing application requiring over night for drying or hardening,
the total time is quite long even with the simple finish of filler, shellac,
and wax. If the pupil wishes a very dark finish, a stain which requires
one or more periods must precede his filler.</p>

<p>In high school, pupils come every day thus permitting the application
of rubbed varnish finishes, either shellac or copal, without unnecessary
loss of time. Here special finishing rooms are necessary.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec5"><b>5. Structural and Decorative Design.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Among other requirements
for a course in woodwork and drawing as stated in the foreword
is this: “At least a few problems should be given which involve
invention or design or both, thereby stimulating individual initiative on
the part of the pupils.” The present outlines in woodwork and drawing
have been planned with this in mind. In the seventh grade the pupil is
given little opportunity to exercise his initiative in either woodwork or
drawing. The reason for this, as has been previously stated, is a firm
belief that initiative in any subject to be of value must be based upon a
fair knowledge of the subject matter dealt with, its limitations and its
possibilities. In other words, that appreciation must precede invention
or initiative.</p>

<p>With the limited time allowed manual training, at most one-half
day each week in the general educational scheme, a seventh grade beginner
has about all he can well manage in becoming familiar with his
subject matter, with learning to handle his tools and work his material.</p>

<p>But one group in the seventh grade will admit of decorative design.
These problems, Group VI, have purposely been made simple as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span>
woodwork that the pupil may give most of his attention to the design.
In eighth grade, modifications of outline and dimensions of any project
are permitted where a fair degree of merit is shown. Modifications of
joints or fastenings are not to be made, however, unless a pupil wishes to
transfer a project from some other group into the group in which the
class is working.</p>

<p>In high school the pupil is expected to “work up” in his drawing class
projects original in so far as his ability will permit, subject to limitations
mentioned hereafter.</p>

<p>Eighth grade boys are expected to make at least one application of
decorative design to the pieces of woodwork made. The projects made
by the high school boys are, as a rule, not so well calculated to take
decorative design. Their efforts at decorative design will come later in
connection with the metalwork of the first year.</p>

<p>In high school the design is to be taught by special drawing teachers
who have informed themselves of the limitations of the shop methods
when it comes to applying these designs. It is for the shop instructor to
specify the kind of joint or joints that are to be used and the material,
also the limitations as to decoration. Present methods of organization
in high schools hardly permit of the teaching of shopwork and design
and by the same instructor, which is the ideal way providing, of course,
that the instructor is expert in both. This is a combination difficult to
find. It is gratifying, however, to know that some schools are insisting
that their shop men become informed in design as well as shopwork.</p>

<p>While these drawings are being worked up in the drafting room the
pupil’s shop periods are given over to the making of the exercise joints
and mastering the principles involved in their making. By the time
these exercises are completed, the working drawing will be completed
ready for use in the shop.</p>

<p>The proper correlation of design and shopwork is not a problem
beyond solution, because of the direct relation of the two departments,
providing there is a strong administrative head able to secure proper
<i>esprit de corps</i>. In the grammar schools, however, the problem becomes
less satisfactory of solution by correlation.</p>

<p>The first objection lies in the fact that the regular grade teacher has
both boys and girls to teach and the problems must therefore be the same
for the whole room. The second objection lies in the fact that the
problem in design has to pass thru too many hands before it reaches the
boy. If design is to be taught to the best advantage, it must have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
interest of the teacher and she must have an intelligent understanding
not only of the subject of design but of the particular problem that is
to be presented. The difficulties in the way are not insurmountable
where the drawing supervisor herself presents the problem to the pupils.
Even here, however, one frequently finds the drawing supervisor so
much more interested in the freehand drawing that her dislike for the
design makes her unfitted for such correlation work.</p>

<p>When, however, as is the case in cities, the drawing supervisor must
reach the pupils thru the regular teacher, correlation becomes in most
every instance a farce. The teaching of design is another imposition on
an already overburdened grade teacher. Very seldom does she understand
the problem and it becomes a distasteful subject to be got over in
the easiest way possible. Department teaching in the upper grammar
grades would do much to aid in the correlation of drawing and shop.
Until this is made possible, we can hope for little in the way of results
from grammar school correlation, unless it be in a small system where
the supervisor teaches the children directly.</p>

<p>The whole subject of design as it relates to woodworking is a constant
source of discussion among manual training shop men. Many good
teachers insist that design has no place at all in a course in woodworking.
Others admit that it ought to have a place but feel that the results
obtained do not justify the time spent upon it. Still others approach the
whole field of woodworking from the side of design, tool processes and
organized woodworking subject matter being mere incidents to the
problem in design.</p>

<p>Like every extreme position each of these points of view has good in
it, but there is sufficient error accompanying each to impair the validity
of the conclusions and to make the resulting applications unhappy as
related to ordinary public school conditions.</p>

<p>The whole subject of design as it relates to the manual training shop
is one that has demanded thought on the part of the author. It is one
of those places where teaching theory failed to bring efficiency either in
the results obtained in design or in the reaction upon the boy. He has
been forced to the opinion, from his own experience and from his
observation of the efforts of others to teach design to grammar school
pupils, that the cause for dissatisfaction and discouragement is due to
our insistence upon one and only one method of presentation&mdash;the inductive
or synthetic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page44">[44]</span></p>

<p>In judging results we must consider the results obtained from every
member of a class and the good each boy has got out of his experience.
This efficiency test most effectively excludes the exhibition of a few
“accidentals” as evidence that our method is the correct one. There is
no reason why design should seek justification on any ground other
than that offered by other subjects.</p>

<p>Inductive or synthetic teaching of design has its place; so also has the
deductive or analytic. Happily those educators who insist on the use
of one method or the other only are becoming few. In other subjects
we are finding that the teaching results which demand the respect and
approval of educators of safe and sane judgment are obtained by the use
of both methods interchangeably. There is no formal notice when one
is to be used or the other&mdash;whichever method fits the occasion is used
without apology. This is right; to do otherwise is to sacrifice the boy
or girl for the sake of the method. We are all agreed that the child is
the more important consideration. In fact, some psychologists tell us
that induction and deduction are one and the same process, the difference
being merely a matter of emphasis. It is this difference in placing the
emphasis that we seek to discuss.</p>

<p>Our methods in the high school have made much of the inductive.
This is right. Pupils of high school and college age are ready for this
method, tho our high school pupils often would profit by having a little
less of this with more of the deductive.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to grammar school teaching, the maximum
of use has to be made of the deductive or analytic method. This is
acknowledged in the academic subjects. Woodworking when taught
so as to meet the efficiency test that is applied to academic teaching also
makes use of this method mostly. Our design, however, has always been
taught by the inductive or synthetic method, no one seeming to have the
temerity to make use of any other. As a result we find the views of
design in the grammar school as stated above. Those who advocate it
urge the “accidentals” as sufficient justification. Those who reject it
base their argument on the fact that results based on a few accidentals
will not satisfy the same efficiency test that is applied to other subjects.</p>

<p>Experience has shown, at least to the author’s satisfaction, that the
deductive or analytic method when given maximum emphasis with beginners
in design is all that is needed to bring the results up to a standard
equal to that of other subjects. It is the rational method of presenting
any subject to beginners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span></p>

<p>The terms deductive and inductive have such wide application that it
may be well to specify more particularly just what we mean. A concrete
illustration will suffice to show the distinction we seek to make between
what we choose to designate the deductive or analytic and the inductive
or synthetic methods.</p>

<p>Suppose we wish to have a class, with little or no information about
the subject, design a booklet to meet certain specified conditions. Three
distinct stages of progress manifest themselves in what we shall call the
complete method. First, the pupils must be given information bearing
upon the problem. Second, they must be given experience in handling
problems of that type. Third, they will utilize this information and
experience in designing the booklet to meet given conditions.</p>

<p>The first step will be the taking of a type form and analyzing it.
Either the instructor will demonstrate or, better, each pupil may be given
a booklet of type form and required to take it apart and put it together
again. Any way to give the pupil the information in a form that will
cause it “to stick.” In woodwork, it would be done by means of the
traditional shop demonstration&mdash;a wise practice, since psychology teaches
us that sight percepts are among the strongest.</p>

<p>Second, the pupils must acquire experience. Let them make a booklet
according to definite specifications provided them by the instructor.</p>

<p>The process thus far is mainly deductive or analytic. So far there has
been no invention or design, but the pupils are now prepared for it.
Using the information and experience now available, let them design a
booklet to meet certain conditions. This latter part we would call the
inductive or synthetic process.</p>

<p>We should have two aims in our teaching of design: (1) Appreciation,
(2) Development of the creative faculty. Since all must be able
to appreciate good line and good form when they get out into life while
only a few will ever become designers in a creative sense, it is essential,
as it is also rational, that attention should be paid first to appreciation.
Past efforts show how hopeless is the problem when we strive to give
to the pupils appreciation of and feeling for line and form by demanding
original forms in the very beginning. The beginner’s efforts at creation
are abortive and the appreciation that he derives is nil. By our insistence
on this method we have given to our pupils the idea that design means
making something out of nothing. He is not far wrong if we demand
of him original designs before we have given him anything tangible upon
which to work. We say tangible as distinguished from academic principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
or rules of design. If nothing tangible is given the pupil he must
get it outside of his school experience. This explains the superabundance
of “wienerwurst” forms, bouquets tied with ribbons, circles, etc., etc.</p>

<p>It is possible to create unknown out of what is seemingly unknown.
When we stop to analyze the process, however, we find that we have
made use of information, appreciation, and feeling that are known.
Sometimes we make ourselves believe that our pupils are creating unknown
out of unknown without these requisites. Analysis will show
that our continued suggestions to him, drawn from our own fund of
known are the causes, and not the pupil’s faculty. This method of
teaching is the kind we have been used to in design. It works pretty
well with small classes and individual instruction. Try it on large
classes of beginners and it is not possible to bring results that stand for
class efficiency.</p>

<p>And why should this particular method be insisted upon exclusively
with beginners? Why should not design, like mechanical drawing and
woodwork and other subjects be developed upon a substructure consisting
of information and appreciation secured by allowing or even insisting
that the boy handle good design until he becomes saturated with a feeling
for good line and good form? Of course, if any pupil comes to a
beginning class with this information and feeling, due allowance should
and can readily be made. It is highly probable that there would be
less inclination on the part of our pupils to insist that designers are born
not made were more use made of the deductive method. When the boys
no longer see their efforts result in crudities and are enabled to acquire
the necessary feeling and information as their work proceeds, then you
find a happy and interested class that as a whole takes design as a matter
of course and not as something intended only for the few.</p>

<p>Whatever the method of teaching design in the regular classroom,
lack of time demands the most direct treatment of shop design. A
grammar school boy is not inclined to listen very patiently to anything
that smacks of the academic. (1) Give the boy something definite with
which to work and (2) keep him working, or “playing,” as one has
fittingly designated it, until he has made a conscientious effort to “make
it a part of himself,” that is, until he succeeds in changing the form until
it no longer resembles the original but still possesses the pleasing appearance
of the original.</p>

<p>If he succeeds in doing this, he is well on the way to creative effort.
Not all boys are of equal ability in other lines of endeavor, neither are<span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
they in this. By this method of attack, however, even the stupidest&mdash;usually
stupid only in the matter of design&mdash;is not without compensation
for his effort. He has learned somewhat of the principles that govern
good design by hearing them explained and seeing them illustrated in a
piece of good design. He will have developed some feeling for line and
form thru having played with good line and form. He can at the very
least fit the form given him to an outline made by himself after suggestions
of good line placed upon the board. To this extent, at least,
you have benefited him, whereas, by the usual method he&mdash;and there are
many like him&mdash;would have simply sat idle in discouragement&mdash;if he
were not more mischievously occupied.</p>

<p>If our old art schools were to be criticised because they made too much
use of the imitative method when they strove to give to their students
information and appreciation and feeling for form and line thru copying
historic ornament, it would seem, from results obtained, both tangible
and in the effect upon the pupils, that our modern schools are open to
criticism when they seek to force originality upon immature minds before
they have given these minds any information or feeling.</p>

<p>Of course grammar school boys are not interested in historic ornament,
at least not in America. This is the weakness of the imitative method
and helped to bring in the movement which now seems to have swung
to the opposite extreme&mdash;it lacks vitality for young pupils. Instead of
giving the boy historic fragments, give him a form that is vitally interesting
to him because he sees its immediate application in the thing
that is to be made in wood. Let him play with this form combining
imitation and modification and creation just as far as he is able.</p>

<p>Make the problem concrete, stating the principles you have to state
in a language the boy can understand. There will not be time to bring
out every principle that might be involved in design. There must be
time to bring out those involved in the particular problem under discussion.
Balance and symmetry, for illustration, are pretty well understood
by the boy in the simple form in which he will have occasion to use them.</p>

<p>Take as an illustration the bookrack, <a href="#Fig7">Fig. 7</a>. To present such a
problem we would place upon the blackboard the blank forms as shown,
also the decorative form as shown.</p>

<p>The lesson immediately divides itself into two parts for consideration:
(1) The Construction, (2) The Decoration. Under the subject of
Construction our normal school notes would suggest the following points
to be brought up: Use, Construction, Decoration; Requirements of
Utility; Limitations of Materials and Processes; Proportions of Parts
and Details; Harmony of Parts and Details; Points of Force; Construction
as Decoration. (According to Payne.) Under Decoration:
Supporting Outline; Center of Interest; Symmetry; Repetition; Radiation;
Rhythm; Contrast; Proportion in Curves; Proportion in Spaces;
Unity; Subordinate Centers of Interest; Balance.</p>

<p>Taking these in their natural order, but without making much ado
about the “framework,” the shop man who has made some study of the
principles involved can call the boys’ attention to the most important
points:</p>

<p>(1) The construction. Since the shopwork is to be carried on by
class instruction and not individually, it will be necessary to limit the
joint or joints used to those specified for the Group in which the project
is to be worked out. Joints of previous Groups may be used also. The
book rack will be made in Group VII. Some form of the groove joint
is to be used, none other.</p>

<p>Here we call attention to the difference between the designer and the
shop man in their handling of the problem. The discussion of construction
gives the designer an opportunity to display the possibilities
of his subject. He enumerates all the joints that may be used with
propriety in making such a piece as the bookrack, and the pupils are
encouraged to make use of as many varieties as possible. He is totally
oblivious of the fact that, while this is good teaching in design, it is
making the applications impossible except with individual instruction&mdash;a
method of instruction that may be used in small school systems but not
in cities.</p>

<p>(2) The manner of placing the members and the use to which the
rack is to be put will together determine the proportions of the members.</p>

<p>(3) For decoration, we might depend entirely upon the good form
of the outline and the stain and grain of the wood. With this particular
piece, however, we shall make use of a decorative form which will be
outlined or incised and colored with a dye.</p>

<p>(4) Since the design is to be made in wood and wood splits easily
along the grain, we must be careful in making an outline not to get
sharp points. Also, in making a decorative design we must avoid thin
parts that will bring incised lines close together. Also, we must take
into account in planning the members the facts of shrinkage or swelling
and the strength of the wood. The grain on the vertical members must
extend vertically and that of the horizontal member must extend from<span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span>
vertical member to vertical member. This to be illustrated by referring
to some similar construction.</p>

<p>(5) In striving for pleasing outlines, or decorative forms either,
strive to avoid a sameness made by using many lines or forms of the same
size. “Large, medium and small” is a key that unlocks many a puzzle
as to what causes unpleasant feelings in both outline and decoration.
Long sweeping curves with short snappy ones, rather than a series made
with a compass. Make a special point of the fact, which almost every
boy overlooks, that the simple forms of outline are invariably the more
pleasing. To the beginner design means making something unlike anything
that was ever seen on the earth below or heaven above&mdash;hence the
freakish, fussy forms that are usually offered. Try telling the class you
are going to place an excellent form on the board then draw a well
proportioned oblong and watch the expressions on their faces. Yet a
well proportioned oblong with appropriate decorative form is one of the
most pleasing of forms. There will be no need to urge them to make
“unique” forms. Their inexperience and their zeal will produce a
sufficient number. Rather urge, or insist that they postpone search for
“unique” form until they have more information.</p>

<p>Illustrate with blackboard sketches as you go along each of these
points. Keep the boys “playing” with outline forms until you have
assured yourself they have done their best. With them, pick out three
of the best and place these in permanent form for keeping&mdash;put them
on another sheet of paper. Next, start them on the decoration. The
development of a decorative form will come much harder than the
outline. Here again the beginner will want to exhibit “unique” forms&mdash;unique
only in that they are founded upon his ignorance. Unless the
boy is not a beginner, it will be necessary in about twenty-four out of
every twenty-five cases to insist that he start with the form you have
placed upon the board for his use. If you were dealing with a few
pupils, you might take his “original” form and step by step get him to
work it into a good form. With large classes this is not possible, nor is
it necessary. Simply insist that he place the form given him in his
outline and in so doing he will acquire enough feeling for line and form
to enable him to proceed of his own accord.</p>

<p>(6) Have the boy put on a supporting outline, that is, tell him to
draw a line around his outline and parallel to it. Show the class on
the blackboard how this is to be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span></p>

<p>(7) Put in the main mass and break it up explaining as you do so
that you are seeking to get large, medium and small forms-proportion of
parts. Call attention to the efforts made to keep the lines in harmony.</p>

<p>(8) Call attention to the center of interest you have created. It is
unfortunate that lack of time forbids the boy’s placing colors on these
designs. Very frequently a touch of color is used to create a center of
interest, the form for this in black and white not giving the proper
significance at all. A design which in outline seems to be fussy because
of too many parts will, by a proper selection and placing of colors, be
made most pleasing. On the other hand, a design in outline that seems
agreeable may, when in color, not be agreeable because the colors make
certain parts stand out too prominently. A study of the color plate in
<i>Projects in Beginning Woodwork and Mechanical Drawing</i> will make
this clear.</p>

<p>(9) If the form proposed happens to illustrate repetition, radiation,
symmetry, or if some boy develops a form that does, take time to say a
word about them. While you will not have time to “teach design” in
the few lessons, a word here and there may serve to awaken further interest
on the part of some boy.</p>

<p>After all is said, we recognize that the time is short, that not much
can be done. On the other hand, what little can be done is worth doing
and doing well; its possible significance can not be overestimated.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec6"><b>6. Shop Excursions.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">In the grammar schools, and more especially
in the high schools, plans should be made for several excursions
to near by shops in which the pupils may get an insight into the workings
of related industries. The saw-mill, lumber yards, planing mills, furniture
factories, architectural or drafting-rooms and, in fact, anything
relating to the industrial employment of men and machinery may be
visited.</p>

<p>That the trip may be one of profit the instructor should see to it that
the pupils are prepared for the trip by previous talks on what is to be
seen and by after talks on the meaning of what they saw.</p>

<p>In every case it will be necessary, or at least advisable, to have a time
arranged with the superintendent of the factory to be visited. Pupils
should be given to understand that they are being privileged and must
act the part of gentlemen, refraining from asking needless questions of
the workmen or handling the equipment. In many factories no talking
to the men at all is desired. The questions of young pupils are often
impertinent and embarassing without their intending them so to be. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
better plan is, as has just been suggested, to have the pupils prepared by
preliminary talks then take them thru the shop with eyes and ears only
open, clinching the lessons of observation afterward.</p>

<p>Pupils should keep together in solid lines and, should any accident
occur, the instructor should see that any loss to the factory owner or
workmen is “made good.” Usually the class will voluntarily make
recompense. It is safer and less likely to cause embarassment if it is
understood beforehand that all members of the class who go will be
expected to help repay the instructor for any money so expended.</p>

<p>One might think the company well able to stand such loss. It is,
but it is not always the company’s loss. Even if it were, their courtesy
ought not to be abused. We have in mind a mold for an intricate piece
of casting representing a day’s labor for two men ruined by a student’s
accidentally brushing against it with his overcoat. As the men were on
“piece work” it meant no loss to the company, except delay in getting
out the finished article. It did mean a loss to the two men, who could
ill afford it. The instructor quietly settled for the damage or loss and
the pupils reimbursed him upon reaching school. This probably prevented
the factory from excluding succeeding classes as undesirables.
In woodworking shops there is little chance for such accidents. Nevertheless
workmen there do not wish their tools or work handled. Each
class should bear constantly in mind, while on the shop excursions, that
it is making succeeding classes welcome or unwelcome in that shop.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec7"><b>7. Stock Bills.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Every piece of woodwork made by a pupil consisting
of more than one member should have in addition to the working
drawing a carefully made stock bill. The reason is two-fold: It not
only prevents the pupil’s cutting out stock wrongly thru misreading the
drawing, but it saves time for the pupil. It is a practice that he will
have to master later in life if he follows any of the mechanical trades
and is just as essential a part of his shopwork as is the drawing or
woodwork. Where the drawings are made by referring to plates, experience
has shown that many a boy will be able to make a good drawing
without fully interpreting its meaning. The making of the stock
bill will show him his weakness, also it will show the instructor. No
boy can make out his stock bill without being able to read his drawing.
After the drawing has been made and then its stock bill, the boy will
have become so conversant with the plans of the thing he is to make
that few mistakes are made in working the wood, that is, mistakes due
to ignorance of the drawing.</p>

<p>All articles in seventh grade will be made of White Pine or Yellow Poplar; those in eighth grade of Chestnut.</p>

<p>Stock bills are not needed for articles composed of one piece of material only.</p>

<p>Finished sizes are the sizes to which the pieces are to be planed. Your drawing will tell you these sizes.</p>

<p>Pieces of irregular shape are to be figured at their widest and longest dimensions.</p>

<p>Cutting sizes are obtained from the finished sizes by adding <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>″
to the width and <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>″ to the length. Cutting
sizes are the sizes to which you work in sawing out the stock preparatory to planing it.</p>

<p>All stock will be mill-planed on two surfaces to the correct thickness except that for the ring toss, spool holder,
game-board, and laundry register. Thickness of mill-planed stock will be the same whether for finished sizes or
cutting sizes. On rough stock, or stock that has not been mill-planed, if the finished size is
<sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>″ thick the cutting
size will be 1″ thick.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is possible to save material by combining two irregular pieces. The finished stock sizes will
indicate the number of pieces while the cutting size will indicate the size of the single piece from which they are
to be cut.</p>

<p>Remember that length always means “along the grain of the wood,” and that a piece may be wider than long.
Under the word “Pieces” put the number of pieces that are of the same size.</p>

<p>In the elementary schools the form of stock bill used should be as
simple and explicit as is possible. The appended form is one that has
proven satisfactory. That it may be in convenient form for student
use, it has been included with “<i>Projects in Beginning Woodwork and
Mechanical Drawing</i>,” as also is the Form for Price List and Estimate
of Cost.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec8"><b>8. Estimating Cost of Material.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The accompanying form
indicates clearly what is expected of the boys in figuring their cost of
material. Since these costs are figured before the articles are made in
wood, no account is taken of material wasted. With a carefully
planned course of projects and an instructor who knows the possibilities
of requiring a boy to reduce the size of his piece when one member has
been reduced under size there is very little use for extra stock. As a
rule what stock is so returned can be used for other smaller parts. If
a boy is unnecessarily wasteful, he should be required to figure extra
stock. This is to be done only in justice to the other boys, not as a
check to the wasteful boy. Such boys, as a rule rather glory in their
wastefulness. The best check for such a boy is to require him to use
his original stock, reducing the sizes of all affected pieces as may be
necessary.</p>

<p>As this is, in all probability, the first problem in which the boys
deal with approximate rather than mathematically exact results, the
instructor should not become discouraged with their first attempts. No
better opportunity exists for introducing the boys to problems such as
will confront them after they leave school. The instructor will do
well to check the boys’ results by means of his own previously figured
results after the boys are all thru their figuring. There is a difference
between figuring for an answer previously given and figuring as they
must after leaving school.</p>

<p>In order for the boy to figure his bills he must have a Price List.
A form for a price list such as is needed for the materials that are
to be used in “<i>Projects in Beginning Woodwork and Mechanical
Drawing</i>” is appended. The prices given are neither retail nor wholesale
but about midway between what the boy would have to pay for
his stock bought in the limited quantity he needs and the cost to the
school in quantity lots. Only the best of lumber is used. Money
might be saved by buying short lengths but none is saved by buying
“cull” stock with the expectation of cutting out the defects. The prices
are for Chicago, 1911-1912, and are inserted for comparison only. On
lumber, 15 to 25 per cent has been added for waste in cutting up.
Since all of the stock used in the grades is in board form, wood finish
is figured only for the two broad surfaces. The price will be found
sufficient to cover the material used on edges. The price will also
cover such waste as ordinarily comes thru the inexperienced handling
on the part of the boys&mdash;they will not “spread out” the materials to as
good advantage as will a mechanic, of course.</p>

<p class="center highline2">INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<p>Base your lumber estimate on the Cutting Sizes. All prices of lumber in your Price List are per square foot,
therefore your stock should be figured by surface measure, only width, length, and number of pieces being considered.</p>

<p>Fractions of an inch and fractions of a cent are not considered, except in the price per foot, and in the number
of feet as noted in the next paragraph. If the fraction is <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>
or over, use the next higher whole number; thus,
2<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> or 2<sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> becomes 3. If the fraction is less
than <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>, drop it; thus, 2<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> becomes 2.</p>

<p>In figuring, find the number of square inches in all pieces that are the same in price per foot. Reduce this to
square feet by dividing by 144. Reduce it decimally and do not carry the result beyond tenths place. Dispose of
any fractional figures beyond tenths as directed above. Always write your decimal as a
fractional form in the bill&mdash;otherwise
a decimal point might be overlooked and the result be greatly changed. In the form above note that
.3 is written <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub>.</p>

<p>In figuring finish, both surfaces of the stock are to be covered so that the easiest way to find the number of
square feet of finish is simply to double the number of square feet of lumber. Edges are not considered. Only
Groups VI, VII, and VIII have finish applied.</p>

grammar schools the lumber is figured by surface measure per square
foot and the form of bill is made as simple as is possible. A high
school boy should be able to handle a problem somewhat more in
keeping with commercial practice. In addition to the material cost he
should keep account of the time expended in making his piece of woodwork
so that he may figure the labor cost as well. The small size of
the stock used does not admit of the full commercial practice. This,
however, ought to be explained to the class at this time. The following

<p class="center highline2">INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<p>Under “pieces” put the number of parts that are alike.</p>

<p>Under “size” put the various dimensions of pieces. In finding the sizes of
the various pieces of lumber, examine the working drawings for finished dimensions,
making due additions for tenons, then add <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>″ to the width and <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>″ to
the length to allow for cutting out and squaring up. Tho you are to make use
of stock mill-planed to thickness, you are to specify the thicknesses from which
this mill-planed stock is got. Allow <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>″ for mill-planing.</p>

<p>Remember that length always means along the grain.</p>

<p>Fractions of an inch in width and length are not considered. Neither are
fractions of a cent in the final results. If the fraction is <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> or over, take the
next higher whole number. If it is less than <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>, drop it. Fractions of an inch
in thicknesses that are over 1″ and fractions of a cent in the price per foot are
to be figured as they are.</p>

<p>Lumber is measured by the superficial foot which is 1″ × 12″ × 12″. Boards
that are less than 1″ thick are sold by surface measure. In other words, boards
less than 1″ thick are figured for quantity as 1″ thick.</p>

<p>Standard sawed thicknesses are 1″, 1<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>″, 1<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>″,
2″, 2<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>″, 3″, 3<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>″, 4″. Thicknesses
less than 1″ necessitate re-sawing these sizes. In some communities the
price per square foot for re-sawed stock varies for each difference of <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>″ in
thickness.</p>

<p>In figuring, multiply the length by the width by the thickness, by the number
of pieces. If any piece is less than 1″ thick figure it as 1″. Combine all results
that are the same in price per foot. Reduce to square feet by dividing by 144.
Reduce decimally and do not carry the result beyond tenths place. Dispose of
any fractional part beyond tenths as directed above. Write your result in
fractional form that the decimal point may not be overlooked and be the cause
of trouble.</p>

<p>The price list gives the price of lumber per 1,000 feet. The price per foot
is readily obtainable.</p>

<p>In figuring finish for these cabinet pieces, double the number of feet of stock
as given by the stock bill to get the number of feet of finish. This is only an
approximate method but is sufficiently accurate for such pieces as are to be made
in first year high school, as specified in “Advanced Projects in Woodwork,”
Group IX.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec10"><b>10. Standardizing Materials and Tools.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Standardization
in the manual training shop is just as desirable and as profitable as in
commercial shops. Not infrequently young teachers begin their work
with the idea that the greater variety of tools and materials they can
introduce into their course the richer is its content. To a certain
extent this is true but experience will soon prove that there is a
limit beyond which it is not profitable to go. In grammar schools,
with classes of twenty, it is inadvisable to have more than one plane
on a bench&mdash;or even in the general tool equipment, if the courses<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
outlined herewith are followed. By planning the joint work carefully
beforehand, or requiring the pupils to plan their joints according to
certain standards as to size, no more than two chisels need be placed
at the disposal of each boy and none in the general equipment. The
same may be said of bits, etc. Make use of certain screw sizes, as few
as can be used to advantage, and equip in auger bits accordingly. This
practice not only is less expensive but it enables the instructor to keep
the equipment well in hand both as to sharpening and accounting.</p>

<p>Except with individual oversight, in small classes, it is not advisable
to plan projects for grammar schools in which holes smaller than <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub>″
diameter are to be bored. The expense of maintaining or replacing
bits of smaller size that get broken is unwarranted.</p>

<p>Of course, it is not to be inferred from the foregoing that any
necessary tool is to be omitted, or that any tool is to be made to do a
work that will cause it to be injured thereby.</p>

<p>There is educational value in the way of imparting information in
providing pupils with a different kind of wood for each project. This
used to be specified in some of the very best courses some years ago.
Today the tendency is not only to standardize the kinds of wood but
to standardize the thickness. The economic problems arising from the
handling of many kinds and sizes of lumber more than offset the informational
value that pertains to the practice. A study of samples of
wood that are placed within easy reach of the pupils will compensate
somewhat for the loss occasioned by standardizing the kinds of stock.
After all, the presentation of three or four type woods is about all that
can be expected, as the work is now presented.</p>

<p>Wood finishes can be standardized in a manner similar to that of
lumber and hardware. There is undoubtedly educational value in a
boy’s making his own stains. Under ordinary school conditions, however,
it is not possible to have him do so. Nor is it advisable for the
instructor himself to mix his own finishing materials. Even the most
expert woodfinishers find it taxing their ability to mix a fresh lot of
stain that will exactly match that of a previous lot. There is nearly
always some boy, or boys, with pieces but partly covered when the stain
in any given lot is exhausted. The best way, everything considered, is
to make use of some standard color of finish in stain and filler. When
a given quantity is exhausted it is an easy matter to order more of the
same color with the assurance that the color of the new lot will match<span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span>
that of the old. It is not possible to teach everything in the short time
allowed and there are excellent reasons for omitting these.</p>

<p>The price list and the list of equipment given herein show to what
extent the author has standardized his material and tools.</p>

<p>The foregoing form is for use in grammar school centers. One book
for each center will suffice. On the cover, the instructor will fill in
the name of the school at which the center is located, also his own name.</p>

<p>There should be placed after “school” on the inner page the name of
the school from which any class of boys come. Their grade and the
name of their academic teacher is to be filled in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page62">[62]</span></p>

<p>In marking attendance in the class book, use a short straight line for
absence. If a boy is marked absent and later comes in, a straight
horizontal line thru the vertical line made to indicate absence will
indicate tardiness. By arranging these marks in the square in some
definite order the particular time of absence or tardiness can be told.
For example, if a class comes to manual training once a week, a mark
in the upper left hand corner may indicate absence or tardiness the first
week of that month; if in the upper right hand corner, for the second
week, etc.</p>

<p>In the column marked “Grade” will be recorded the teacher’s estimate
of the boy’s work. In some schools boys are required to pay for
material used. The column marked “Acct.” is to be used in keeping
record of money paid by the pupil.</p>

<p>The column marked for deportment is not to be filled unless a boy
insists in calling the instructor’s attention to himself because of his
misconduct. On such occasions a check is recorded after his name at
the time reproof is given.</p>

<p>These books will be taken up by the supervisor of manual training
at the close of the year and will be kept by him.</p>

<p>Boys who enter or leave at times other than the beginning or close
of the regular school period should have the fact and date indicated in
connection with their names.</p>

<p>Where money is collected from students, the supervisor should insist
that the instructor keep a separate purse for this purpose in addition to
keeping a record in his class book. The class book record will be of
service in checking the purse account and in aiding in settling any
dispute between instructor and boy and in giving the supervisor a check
in case any parent asks for information. It is not an unusual thing,
however, for the instructor to find his purse account in excess of his
book account. This is due to the fact that he has forgotten in the stress
of other shop duties to make a record. In such a case the purse account,
not the book account is to be turned in. Since the instructor is not a
purchasing agent there will never be occasion for his book account to
exceed his cash account.</p>

<p>The directions given for the grammar school class book apply equally
to this high school form, except that the week is the unit instead of the
month. If a class comes five days in the week, a mark in each of the
four corners of the square for Attendance and one in the center will
indicate that the boy was absent or tardy five times that week. Always
placing the marks in definite places for definite days will indicate what
day of the week a boy was absent or tardy.</p>

<p>At the end of each month there will need to be sent to the regular
grade teacher information suggested in the following form. This form,
when the teacher takes off the data contained thereon, is to be returned
to the manual training center. The information contained upon this
form is to be used by the regular teacher in making up her monthly
report for the boys whose names are recorded. Deportment and attendance
will be combined with similar marks in the regular work while
the manual training grade will be recorded in the space so indicated
on the regular monthly report.</p>

<p>As for the form of the monthly report for the high school, most high
schools have their marking systems so arranged that the different instructors
can transfer their markings directly from the class book to
the card. If a form is desired, the grammar school monthly report will
answer as well for the high school by changing the words “School” and
“Grade” to “Shop” and “Section.”</p>

<p>To the Teacher&mdash;Deportment is satisfactory unless checked. A boy with two
or more checks needs a word of caution and advice.</p>

<p>Excuses for absence or tardiness are to be given the regular teacher except
where a boy is absent from manual training but is in attendance at the regular
school the same day. In such a case the excuse is to be given the shop instructor.</p>

<p>In addition to this the teacher will appoint a monitor who will telephone to
her the class attendance at the beginning of each manual training period. Unwarranted
absentees are to be attended to by her.</p>

<p>This record is to be returned at the very earliest opportunity to the manual
training shop. Otherwise, it may be the cause of delay in your getting your
class report from manual training the following month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span></p>

<p>In grading work the tendency today is not to try to make fine
distinctions such as 83 per cent, etc. “Excellent” for work that is
equal to that of a mechanic, “Good” for work that is above average,
“Passed” for average work and “Poor” for work that is not acceptable
will be sufficiently exact. If the system of marking is by numbers, mark
by tens, as 90, 80, 70, and 60, seventy being “Passed.”</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec12"><b>12. Shop Conduct.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">In conduct, a boy at the manual training
center should be governed by the same rules that obtain in the regular
school, with slight exception.</p>

<p>It is sometimes argued that shopwork provides an opportunity for
free and natural or unrestricted action on the part of the pupils. This
they argue is a distinct advantage of manual training over the restraint
of the academic classroom and results in greater development educationally.
Theoretically this seems reasonable. Practically, it soon becomes
evident that young pupils, such as our manual training boys, are
lacking sadly in judgment in the power to discriminate between liberty
and license in shop conduct. Allow them the privilege of talking to
one another about necessary matters without asking permission of the
instructor and you must be a strong teacher to prevent abuse of the
privilege. To allow unrestricted conversation, however, is decidedly
bad. Even with grown men and women working in shops, only restricted
conversation is allowed. The reason is evident. If with men
and women of supposed judgment there must be insistence on order and
system, how much more so with immature boys.</p>

<p>Have definite signals and insist upon their being heeded promptly.
The three bells used in the regular school work serve well to open the
school. One, the opening of the doors; two, the call to order; three,
the tardy bell.</p>

<p>Some instructors do not allow the pupils to enter the shop&mdash;do not
open the shop&mdash;until the second bell rings. Other instructors allow the
boys to enter the shop at the first bell and begin work as soon as they
like. The first method is used mainly in large cities where large classes
have to be cared for and where the boys are morally inacute. The
second is preferable in some ways. It allows the pupil to make the most
of his time. It has the disadvantage in that it requires the instructor’s
immediate supervision after the first bell, or else allows the pupil to
commit errors because of no supervision. As a rule it is the boy who
most needs the extra time who does not make use of the privilege.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span></p>

<p>Of course, where pupils are not admitted to the shop before the
second bell, provision must be made for taking care of them inside the
building in inclement weather.</p>

<p>To fully appreciate the merits of either practice it should be explained
that each boy is to be held responsible for the tools at his bench and the
class as a whole for all other tools. Each boy is expected to look over
his tools upon coming into the shop that he may report any tool that
is missing or damaged. Should he fail to make a report until late in
the period, or not at all he should be made to feel the responsibility.
Broken or lost tools should be paid for as the case merits.</p>

<p>At the close of the period, all tools are to be in their places ready for
the instructor’s inspection. It should be explained to the pupils that
this inspection is not to relieve them of responsibility but merely to
assist them in avoiding an oversight.</p>

<p>Unnecessary damage to the bench is to be reported and the responsibility
fixed as is that concerning tools.</p>

<p>At the ring of the tardy bell every boy should be in his place with
his material, ready for work. Since the recitation generally follows the
tardy bell, that should be the signal for quietness and attention such
as is demanded in the regular schoolroom. The instructor will have
marked his attendance by the time the pupils have got in order and the
recitation may begin at once.</p>

<p>Insist upon continued attention during the recitation and demonstration.
The author has made it a point to call upon any boy showing
signs of inattention to recite. No boy likes to be considered a dullard
and usually he will confess to inattention after which the proper note
can be made of it.</p>

<p>Where the full half-day is given to shopwork, a five minute rest
period is advisable. This allows the boys to relax and to make known
to one another their ideas. Where possible, they should be allowed to
move about and converse freely. Under no circumstances, however,
should there be allowed scuffling or loud talk, either at rest or before
the tardy bell. Aside from the damage that might be done themselves
and the equipment, there should be instilled a feeling of respect for the
shop environment.</p>

<p>The instructor should aim to have on each bench as many of the
tools as will be in great demand. The general tools will be kept in a
wall case. Permission should be given to boys to go after any such
tool whenever he needs it without asking for it. Likewise it is advisable<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
to allow boys standing permission to go to the drinking fountain,
if it be in the same room, or to the wash basin or the finishing tables.
It should be understood that there is to be no congregating at these
places. Permission to leave the room should be required.</p>

<p>At the close of the period a tap of the bell will be the signal for the
boys to put away their tools and work, get their wraps, brush off the
shavings from the bench top and from under the bench into the aisle.
When all are ready and the tools have been inspected, the teacher’s
signal to rise, and then to pass may be given. Have the rows instructed
to pass out in a definite order.</p>

<p>A few schools require the boys of the last class of the day to clean
up the entire shop. In many communities this is not advisable for there
is some justice in their complaints that they are not janitors. There
will be no objection by boys in any community, however, to brushing
out from under and around their own benches. This practice makes
the janitor’s work comparatively light and does not offend the boy’s
sense of justice or fitness. They do not object to the cleaning of the
room so much as to the idea of doing what another is paid for doing.</p>

<p>The discussion of ways and means of maintaining discipline is not
appropriate in a book of such brevity as this. Sufficient to say that a
manual training teacher to do his best work should be a teacher well
trained in methods of teaching and the psychological bases back of them.
He should at least understand the art if not the science of good teaching.</p>

<p>Where an instructor is engaged in teaching his entire time it is not
just that he should be required to attend to formal disciplining of pupils.
In most schools, therefore, an instructor, like the regular grade teacher,
conducts his shop as best he knows how. When a boy insists in being
unruly in spite of all the instructor can do, then that boy should be sent
to the principal of the building in which he belongs for further treatment.
The shop instructor will be expected to make use of the many little
devices for maintaining order that are required of other teachers.
Otherwise he will find himself wanting to send boys to the principals
more frequently than he should. His maintenance of order will be a
much easier task than is that of the regular teacher.</p>

<p>While these restrictions may occasionally work a hardship, they
effectually prevent such injustices as the boy who is inattentive during
the demonstration bothering the boy who was attentive, when it comes
to doing the work. Our American boy is not in much danger of being<span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span>
injured by our school requirements of order and discipline. In fact,
he would be benefited by a little more strictness than is now the custom,
both at school and at home.</p>

<p>The high school shop bells will of necessity be those for other classes
with the exception of the double period. There will be no necessity
for a rest period, of course.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec13"><b>13. The Lesson.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">An examination of the Lesson Outlines of
<a href="#Page89">Part II</a> will make clear the component parts of the lesson. These parts
are: Recitation, Preparation for Demonstration, Demonstration, Work.</p>

<p>In making an analysis of the lesson, let us begin with “Preparation
for Demonstration.” The recitation really belongs to the preceding
lesson, and will be discussed last. The preparation for demonstration
consists in having a pupil read aloud sections of a text which bear
directly upon the demonstration which is to follow. The purpose of
this is primarily to assist in preparing the minds of the pupils for the
demonstration. Of course this preparation could be made orally by the
instructor. In centers where the classes repeat the work day after day
for the full week, the instructor finds himself enthusiastic in giving the
beginning classes their lessons but, in spite of good intentions, slighting
the lessons of the classes that come the latter part of the week. The
reading from the text insures every class equal attention. Of course,
the instructor will enliven the text by the addition of information
from his own experience. There are other uses for the text, such as
a reference book in case the worker finds as he works that he has
forgotten some point. Also it enables the instructor to formulate definite
questions on the work with some assurance that the student can answer
them the week following. The preparation must not be too elaborate.
This is a common fault of beginners in teaching. It is a means, not an
end.</p>

<p>Some instructors object to reading before the demonstration on the
ground that it detracts from the demonstration. When one thinks
only of the exercise of observation this seems reasonable. It must be
remembered, however, that young pupils are not skilled in making
observations as are grown people. It is wise therefore to give them
some aid in making their observations by giving them preliminary hints.
In fact, those instructors who object to the preliminary reading frequently
do precisely the same thing, that is prepare the boys for the
demonstration, when they talk during the demonstration&mdash;they usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span>
explain each step just before taking it. With the preliminary reading
of the text very little talking need interrupt the demonstration, which
may proceed rather rapidly.</p>

<p>Here one sees the necessity for a well organized course. Each lesson
must have its subject matter connected with previous knowledge of the
class.</p>

<p>A successful demonstration demands an equipment such that each boy
may see what is being done by the instructor. The closest of attention
should be demanded. The matter to be demonstrated should be unfolded
step by step. It is not necessary that all the steps be given.
Any steps that have been given in a previous demonstration may be
presupposed. Little time should be lost between the demonstration and
its application.</p>

<p>The remainder of the lesson, the recitation, is to be given at the
beginning of the next period or session. If shopwork has been lacking
in one thing more than another it has been in the failure of the instructor
to “clinch” his instruction. “The best test that a person has
understood a thing is, that he can reproduce it in his own way in his
own words.”</p>

<p>The woodshop instructor has a right and, in justice to the boys and
his work, should insist that they stand squarely upon both feet and express
the information asked for in good, plain, correct English. A boy
who says he “knows but cannot tell it” only half knows. Unless he
learns the lesson well enough to express it well, that lesson will soon
fade so that when the instructor attempts to build upon that knowledge
later, as he must, there will be trouble for both teacher and boy.</p>

<p>In written tests insist upon a definite form and neat papers. For
example, on one line have the date and name, one to the left side of the
paper and the other to the right. In the middle of the paper on the
line just below this, have the name of the subject. Insist upon marginal
spaces at either side of the paper. Do not have the questions copied
upon the boys’ papers, but insist that their answers shall be in the form
of complete statements, a subject and predicate&mdash;so complete that the
instructor need not refer to the question to mark the answers.</p>

<p>At all times use good English, never rough language if you expect
the boys to respect you and the surroundings. Quietly correct their
grammatical errors. These things cost little in effort and assist in
overcoming the slovenly tendencies so characteristic of boys at this age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span></p>

<p>In the Lesson Outlines will be found questioning hints under Recitation.
Some fifteen or twenty years ago our text books in geography,
grammar, history, etc., had suggestive questions after each lesson. These
questions were very helpful but like many another good thing they
were abused. Weak teachers found it easier to conduct a recitation by
putting these questions to the students in routine order, instead of using
them merely as hints to enable them to present to the pupils all the
matter of the lesson. To conduct a recitation by asking routine questions
like conducting a recitation with a text open before the teacher
when pupils are required to recite without the text, is not the sign of
the highest type of teaching and is bound to result in more or less
formalism and lack of vital interest.</p>

<p>Of recent years, texts have gone to the other extreme and not a few
educators are wishing texts would give some hint as to the points of
importance in the lesson. This the present book aims to do in the
hints by questions under Recitation. These questions are purposely
put in an incomplete form so that the instructor must needs formulate
them before putting them to the pupil. They are intended, as are any
public speaker’s notes, merely to enable him to carry on the discussion
or recitation in a systematic and logical manner, missing none of the
important facts to be brought out.</p>

<p>The whole time taken in any one lesson for recitation, preparation
for demonstration and demonstration should not exceed, ordinarily,
twenty-five or thirty minutes.</p>

<p>It is a skilled teacher who can present a lesson to the best advantage.
The best possible presentation is a subject that manual training men
can investigate with profit. Asking questions and getting answers and
giving demonstrations may mean much or may mean little in the way
of developing the boys&mdash;nor can you tell always by the material results
obtained&mdash;it all depends upon how these things are done.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec14"><b>14. Maintenance.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">By maintenance we refer to the cost of keeping
a center running after it has once been fully equipped, exclusive
of teachers’ salaries. This will be found to have several variable factors
entering. A careless instructor can very quickly run the cost of maintenance
to a point almost prohibitive. The loss of tools by theft, waste
of lumber in getting out stock, etc., the careless planning of the work
so that articles are made, requiring much lumber and little work, quickly
makes inroads upon the appropriation for manual training purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span></p>

<p>An allowance of ten per cent. for depreciation in equipment should
be sufficient under all ordinary conditions. An allowance of one dollar
per pupil per year should be ample where all material used is provided
free. In fact, observation covering a period of several years shows that
boys coming one-half day a week for the school year of ten months and
making models similar to those in “<i>Projects in Beginning Woodwork
and Mechanical Drawing</i>” cost the Board approximately seventy-six
cents per pupil for maintenance. This center had very close supervision,
however, and waste and breakage was reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>The most prolific source of monetary outlay is caused by planning
projects&mdash;it makes no difference whether they are small or large, a boy
uses just as much lumber in a given amount of time,&mdash;that require
little effort in their construction. For illustration, a boy may make a
taboret with four solid sides and with butt joints where he should be
making a taboret with grooved joints. The former construction has
its place, but should not monopolize the whole scheme as it is so often
allowed to do. A course properly planned will show that the cost of
eighth grade work, such as taborets, etc., is no greater than that of the
seventh grade which is composed of much smaller but more numerous
projects.</p>

<p>Again, it is a mistake to plan many small projects consisting of small
parts in the hope of effecting economy. The awkwardness of the
average grammar school boy will make it necessary to discard much of
such stock. Where the parts are of some size, it is possible in most
every instance to give him a new but smaller set of dimensions and
require him to continue to work on the piece originally given.</p>

<p>A scrap box for holding small pieces that remain after cutting out
stock from the board, closely supervised so that the boys shall look over
the pieces it contains before cutting a full board, is another source of
economy. There should be comparatively little “kindling” for the
janitor, if due care is taken by the instructor. Above all things, it
should be understood and enforced that no boy is to discard a piece
once he has worked upon it without the instructor’s permission. This
he seldom needs to give for he can usually show the boy how to make
further use of the piece in question by reducing its size.</p>

<p>While most schools provide the materials free, some do not, but
require the pupils to pay the actual cost of the material used should
they care to take the article home. There is something to be said in
favor of each practice. The latter is not unjust as it provides the<span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span>
necessary training. It tends to make class distinction, however, in
communities where pupils are not able to purchase their pieces. On
the other hand, it discourages the taking of things that are not really
wanted and permits a most economical administration&mdash;provided the
supervisor uses judgment in the selection of his projects. It tends to
make him resourceful in providing projects of interest, which is an
advantage provided the projects selected are in harmony with the
general plans of the course, which is supposed to provide for the orderly
introduction of processes.</p>

<p>High school pupils, according to the course outlined herein, will have
about the same amount of time in the half-year allotted to benchwork
in wood as do the grammar school boys in the full school year. The cost
of maintenance will therefore be approximately the same for the half
year as is that of the grades for the year.</p>

<p>In purchasing supplies it is possible, where the courses are organized
and the materials standardized as indicated herein, to save by ordering
in quantity lots. The lumber can be purchased by the 1,000 feet of the
various thicknesses wanted. Likewise the hardware can be got in
quantity lots, with the assurance that next year’s work will call for
any stock that may not be used the present year.</p>

<p>Short lengths in lumber are just as good as long for manual training
purposes and are cheaper.</p>

<p>Whatever is to be purchased by open quotations should be definitely
specified so that one and only one quality can be delivered.</p>

<p>The printed catalogs of the various dealers with their retail prices
are helpful, tho these prices are always “shaded” when quantity
quotations are asked.</p>

EQUIPMENT.</h3>

</div><!--chapter-->

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec15"><b>15. Equipment.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">In the following discussion, effort is made to
suggest type forms of equipment rather than to offer a complete treatise.
The equipment offered may be added to or reduced as the exigencies
warrant. While it is complete enough to do the work planned in the
outline of the course in woodworking as given herein, and lists everything
necessary to do the work in a most approved manner, it does not
go to the extreme of listing every tool that might be used in a cabinet
shop. It lists every tool that must be used for the work outlined.</p>

<p>While it lists an equipment for grammar school and another for
high school, the grammar school equipment with slight additions can
be made to serve the purpose of high school work just as well in communities
where the same equipment must serve for both.</p>

<p>THE GRADE SHOP. The best arrangement of benches and other
equipment, so far as completeness and convenience is concerned is that
shown in <a href="#Fig8">Fig. 8</a>. This is a floor plan of a grade school center. Montclair,
N. J. An extended teaching experience does not indicate any
way in which this arrangement could be improved.</p>

<p>We quote from a description of this shop which appeared in the
April, 1911, <span class="smcap">Manual Training Magazine</span>.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>The shop shown in the accompanying <a href="#Fig8">illustration</a> is one of six in the town
of Montclair, N. J., and what is said of equipment holds true of the others. It
is unique in that it is housed in a structure especially built for the purpose.
This shop measures 29 by 54 feet, and, having windows on all sides, allows the
arrangement of equipment with but little reference to space or light. The
equipment consists of twenty-four single benches with the usual tools, and a few
essentials for simple metalwork. The benches are partially equipped with rapid-acting
vises, the old wooden ones being replaced as they wear out.</p>

<p>The demonstration theater was designed for a class of twenty, but larger
classes have made twenty-five seats necessary. The demonstration bench has both
woodworking and machinist’s vises. It is used also by students for such metalwork
as comes in connection with the shop projects. This bench is provided with
drawers for tools and compartments for sheet metals, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span></p>

<p>The lumber rack was made by bolting five pieces of 4 × 4-inch chestnut to the
side wall, and inserting six 21-inch lengths of 1<sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>-inch gas pipe in each upright.
Such a rack is convenient, serviceable and inexpensive.</p>

<p>The permanent exhibit case measures 20 inches by 5 feet 6 inches by 12 feet.
It has adjustable shelves, glass doors, and is provided with the same style of
lock as are the general tool case, supply cases and demonstration bench.</p>

<p>The cabinets for pupils’ unfinished work have been planned to meet the
problem of providing a satisfactory place in which a pupil can keep his work
from lesson to lesson. The first requirement of the shop seemed a standard size
locker; secondly, it must be adjustable to provide for various sizes of projects;
and lastly, local conditions demanded a system which could be moved without
difficulty. The idea has developed into what is the most satisfactory system with
which the writer (Albert F. Siepert) has had experience, either as student or
teacher. A sectional case was designed which meets equally the needs of all
classes in the art and handwork department, whether they be bookbinding,
woodwork or sewing. Each section measures 20 in. by 24 in. by 36 in. The
open case in the <a href="#Fig10">illustration</a> shows the maximum number of compartments, eight
pupils to the section, each pupil having a space 8<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>
in. by 10<sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> in. by 18<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> in.
for his work. By removing four or six of the upright partitions, the space may be
given to four or even to two pupils. Thus any piece of work up to 11 in. by
18<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> in. by 34 in. can be kept out of the way and under lock and key. Alternate
sections are assigned to a class to avoid congestion and confusion.</p>

<p>The cost of the building several years ago was $3,500. Local carpenters
built the demonstration theater, lumber rack, cabinets, etc. The demonstration
bench cost $27; the stain and glue tables approximately $4.50 per running foot;
and the cabinets for unfinished work $12 per section.</p>

</div><!--quote-->

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec16"><b>16. Size of Classes.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">It should be noted that the building was
planned originally for twenty benches and that it now contains twenty-four.
Twenty benches ought to be the maximum number so far as the
giving of proper instruction is concerned. When more are given the
instructor the conditions for the most efficient work are not good. This
problem of accommodating twenty-four boys will have to be met, and
may as well be planned for just so long as school directors insist upon
crowding fifty pupils in the regular classroom when the teacher ought
to have but thirty-five or forty to do her best work. Then, too, it
frequently happens that a room contains more boys than girls. Some of
these boys might be sent to another and adjoining center. It is best to
plan to care for twenty-four boys, however, where the regular room
enrolment runs above average. In this case the dimensions of the
building as given in the preceding text should be changed. Enlarge
the width of the building by six feet. This will permit the placing of
the extra demonstration seats upon the platform and also allow sufficient
floor space near the lumber rack for cutting out stock, and about the
finishing table, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page77">[77]</span></p>

<p>In placing benches, plan to have the light enter over the back and
the left end of the bench. That is, when standing at his bench, the
light should strike the pupil in the front and left.</p>

<p>An amphitheater is very desirable both in the high school and the
grade school shop. In large classes it is a necessity. With small classes
it is possible to make use of desk stools arranged about a bench. Many
manual training centers, in fact, most manual training centers, do not
have the amphitheater. This is no argument against its desirability.
It simply means that the boys get but an imperfect understanding of
the demonstration and that their work must suffer accordingly.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec17"><b>17. Lockers.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The locker problem is one that has been a source
of trouble. The <a href="#Sec16">arrangement</a> described in connection with the description
of the Montclair shop is by far the best solution of this problem
that has come to the author’s attention. The extreme length of pieces
that can be accommodated is 34″. A few pieces will be longer than
this. These can be accommodated outside the locker or the locker
sections may be planned large, say 40″ in the clear.</p>

<p>The grindstone is best suited for pupils’ use in sharpening edge tools.
Where a small motor is used for power, it is very desirable to have a
small dry emery grinder for the use of the instructor. Ten dollars will
cover its cost and it will pay for itself quickly. It can be placed near
the grindstone.</p>

<p>Unless the centers have frequent delivery of lumber supplies, or if
there is no central cutting-up station, it may be found advisable to add
to the building described a small room for the storage of quantity lumber
with, possibly, a power saw in it.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec18"><b>18. Bench and Tool Equipment for Grade Center.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">
The individual bench is to be preferred to the two- and four-pupil
bench. Aside from the fact that the double benches are not conducive
to good order and system, it is next to impossible to get such benches
to remain rigid without going to an initial expense that would be
sufficient to purchase the individual bench. Unless they are rigid,
it is an injustice to ask a boy to return accurate work. The effect
that violent work at one side of a double bench will have upon fine or
accurate laying out by some boy on the other side of that bench is not
difficult to imagine. The only argument in favor of a double bench
is economy of space. If space must be economized, it is better to place
the individual benches back to back with just enough space between
them to keep them from touching and thus shaking each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span></p>

<p>The rapid-acting vise is desirable, if it is a good one. Some rapid-acting
vises now on the market are not as desirable as the old fashioned
continuous metal screw vise. A vise is in almost constant use and
should be most carefully investigated before being specified.</p>

<p>This estimate does not include lockers, shelving, machinery, etc. The
cost of lockers, shelving, etc., can be roughly estimated by noting the
price per foot as given in the <a href="#Sec15">description</a> of the Montclair shop. A
grindstone with motor power can be purchased for $30.00 for stone
and $60.00 for motor.</p>

<p>Where the instructor must do much grinding, a No. 101 Cortland
Corundum Wheel Co. Grinder, cost with tool rest and two grinding
wheels complete ready to belt $10.00, will be found an extremely satisfactory
investment.</p>

<p>Where power is not obtainable a Pyko Peerless Dry Emery Grinder,
cost $6.00 with tool rest attachment, will give excellent service. It
cuts much more rapidly than a grindstone and is therefore not so tiring
on the one who turns it.</p>

<p>In justice to other makers of tools it must be explained that the
mentioning of the firm names is due to the fact that indefinite specifications
are worthless. There are other tools as good as those named,<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
some of which are preferred by some manual training men to those
mentioned. Those mentioned are first class in every respect and will
serve to give the dealer an idea of the class of goods you want. It will
be for the purchaser to see that he gets equal quality. By all means,
avoid the poor grade tool whatever its price. Were it not for limited
space the author would like to list other makers of first class tools. If
one is not conversant with the different brands let him consult some of
his mechanic friends.</p>

<p>The prices given are list price for 1911-12, Chicago. A discount of
at least 10 per cent. will be allowed for quantity purchase.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec19"><b>19. Individual Tools.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The individual plane-iron is not absolutely
necessary. It is very desirable since the plane is in constant
use. To make use of the same irons class after class is unjust to the
good worker. He will spend a good part of the period getting his iron
in condition only to find when he comes again the next week that it
all has to be done over again. It puts a premium on slovenliness. True,
the same argument holds for the chisels, and it would be well if individual
chisels could be provided. The chisel is not used nearly so
much as the plane-iron and can, therefore, be used in common much
better than the plane-iron.</p>

<p>No machinery for cutting up stock, is included in the estimate. In
most cities the high school machinery can be used for this purpose. According
to the course outlined, there will be little stock cutting by
machinery required. What little there is might well be done as “busy
work” by the more rapid workers thruout the year. Such stock could
be stored away until needed.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec20"><b>20. Equipment for Mechanical Drawing, Grade Center.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">
Since the teacher of woodworking must also be the teacher of mechanical
drawing in the grade center, no special room for drawing is advisable.
With the first twelve weeks devoted to drawing, the woodworking
benches can be used as drawing tables, the woodworking tools not
being placed until all the drawing work is completed. When the
shop is properly cleaned during the summer vacation there is no
reason for its not being kept as clean as any special drawing room during
the drawing period of twelve weeks. The benches should be scraped
clean and shellaced.</p>

<p>A blackboard is needed for both drawing and woodwork and may as
well be placed in the woodworking shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span></p>

<p>For the most efficient presentation of drawing there will need to be
plenty of blueprints or plates from which the student may work. These
must be so well executed, as to technique, that the pupil will have
before him only the best as models. No one would think of placing
before the writing class other than the best models of style and execution
in penmanship, yet it is not infrequent to find mechanical drawing
students copying from blueprints that are far below standard as to
excellence.</p>

<p>In presenting the problems, models will be found of very great help
to the student in his efforts to interpret the conditions. Too much
dependence should not be placed upon models in the work of older pupils.</p>

<p>There will be needed in addition to the above a knife, scale, compass,
and sandpaper block. The knife and rule used in the woodwork will
serve equally well in the drawing. The sandpaper blocks or pencil
sharpening blocks can be made in the shop.</p>

<p>In connection with these blocks, it will be found expedient to have
them so fastened to the bench that pupils cannot get them on top of the
bench in sandpapering a point on the pencil. This can be done by
fastening the block to the bench with a screw in such a way that it can
be revolved from under the top of the bench when wanted. Otherwise
beginners will have the bench top and then drawings covered with the
fine lead of the pencil.</p>

<p>In getting equipment avoid “baby” sets. A taboret drawing, to be
well made, must be on a scale of <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>″. This, with marginal lines will
mean a paper of 12″ by 18″.</p>

</div><!--centerblock-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span></p>

<p>The personal equipment to be uniform should be purchased by the
school and sold to the pupils.</p>

<p>While this personal equipment may be kept in the woodworking
lockers, some instructors prefer to have a special case of drawers to
hold the drawing envelopes, and blocks of wood with suitable holes for
holding the pencils, erasers, and tacks, monitors being appointed to
look after them.</p>

<p>The paper used need not be as expensive as that of the high school
where problems are to be inked. A manilla paper such as is used in
the regular or freehand drawing classes will answer admirably and can
then be provided by the school. Such paper is usually purchased in
sizes 12″ by 18″ and 9″ by 12″. The former is the desired size for
the eighth grade work and the latter for the seventh grade. A 6″ by 9″
size will be found suitable for stock bills, where printed blanks are not
to be provided.</p>

<p>In the matter of paper, it is possible to practice economy without
detracting from the drawing. All that are not wanted at the close of
the year should be kept and the reverse sides made use of where experimental
penciling is required.</p>

<p>Drawing equipment will be stored when woodwork is begun.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec21"><b>21. High School Joinery Shop.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The general plan of the
wood shop for the high school will depend so greatly upon its relation
to other shops in which wood is worked that the most that can be
hoped by discussing it is that the plan offered may offer a starting point
from which to work. In some communities the one shop will be all
that is needed both for cabinet work, first year joinery, and pattern-making
with, possibly, wood-turning. In other communities the number
of students taking the work may warrant separate shops with full
machine equipment for each. In still others it may be advisable to
have adjoining shops but still necessary to make use of the same
machinery. Some schools plan to have all the classes in one big room,
sometimes having as many as seventy boys with three instructors. If
this latter plan is followed, tho it is not advised, there should certainly
be provided an adjoining demonstration room where the instructors
may talk to the boys without the competing noises of other classes.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a> is a suggestive sketch. It provides for lockers similar in
make-up to those discussed in connection with the grammar school.</p>

<p>General tools are to be kept in a tool room which may be placed
in charge of a student assistant. Each boy is then to be provided with
metal checks. When a tool is asked for the assistant will hang the
student’s check in the place of the tool taken out. Upon the return of
the tool the check will be returned.</p>

<p>First year students may be safely taught to use the band-saw and
jig-saw, with proper safe guards about the former. Other machines are
best kept in a separate room.</p>

<p>Since high school pupils ought to be taught how to apply more
difficult finishes, such as rubbed varnish, than those taught in the grammar
schools, a special room will be necessary in order to avoid the
shop dust. This room should be made fire proof, if possible, and should
have racks about the walls upon which to place work being finished.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Sec22"><b>22. High School Bench and Tool Equipment.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The benches for the use of high school pupils are best when of the
cabinet type having drawers below in which each student may keep his
individual edged tools. Such a bench with drawers enough to accommodate
all the boys that will be able to make use of the bench during
the day, with a hinged or revolving board upon which may be fastened
the general tools that belong to that bench will cost approximately
thirty dollars. This includes a first class rapid-acting vise. The individual
bench in the high school is as desirable as it is in the grades.</p>

<p>Where a high standard of technique is to be demanded of the pupils,
the following tools should be added to those specified for the grammar
school bench equipment:</p>

<p>This list presupposes that the mortising of the first year will be done
by chisel alone, no boring. If mortises are to be bored first, it will be
advisable to equip each bench with a Barber’s 8″ ball bearing brace,
cost $1.45.</p>

<p>In addition to the general tools specified for the grammar school,
make the following changes and additions:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center highline4">GENERAL TOOLS.</p>

<p class="noindent">Omit the rip- and crosscut-saws.</p>

<p class="center highline4">MACHINERY.</p>

<p>For the highest type of work the following machines should be placed
at the disposal of the first year high school classes:</p>

<p class="padl10">Grindstone.</p>

<p class="padl10">Scroll or Jig-saw.</p>

<p class="padl10">Band-Saw.</p>

<p>These machines should have proper safety devices and should be
placed where they will be under the immediate observation of the instructor.
Machines for woodworking vary so greatly in price and
desirability that it is not thought wise to specify any particular make.
Only the experienced man will be called upon to equip with machinery
and such an one will have the information necessary to make the purchase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page86">[86]</span></p>

<p>For the second year, or optional cabinet work, there should be placed
at the disposal of the students, and they should be taught their use, the
following machines in addition to those specified for the first year work:</p>

<p class="padl10">Circular-Saw.</p>

<p class="padl10">Machine Jointer.</p>

<p class="padl10">Planer.</p>

<p class="padl10">Boring Machine and Mortiser.</p>

<p class="padl10">Trimmer.</p>

<p>It is possible so to arrange these machines that the circular-saw and
planer may be used in getting out stock for other classes. The floor
plan given contemplates such use.</p>

<p class="center highline4">EQUIPMENT FOR HIGH SCHOOL MECHANICAL DRAWING.</p>

<p>A special room should be provided for the teaching of high school
mechanical drawing.</p>

<p>A north light is best and the tables should be so placed that the
light may come upon the board from in front and the left. If artificial
light must be used, employ the inverted system.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span> TABLE FOR MECHANICAL DRAWING.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Tables have much to commend them over the pedestal. They are
easily swept around and keep a room looking orderly. <a href="#Fig12">Fig. 12</a> shows
a type of table that is commendable. On the left are drawers for
keeping the students’ instruments. On the right is a drawer for keeping
general equipment that is used by the boys in common. Below this<span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span>
drawer is the cabinet for holding the drawing-boards. These boards
are so locked that only the board belonging to the boy with the key
can be released. Such a table with a top 24″ by 48″ and 41″ high will
cost $30, list price. Estimate for individual equipment will be as
follows:</p>

<p>There will also need to be cases in which to file the envelopes in
which the students keep their completed drawings. If much blueprinting
is to be done, there should be a suitable room with sink and running
water. Where models are used, there should be a case for storing
them when not in use.</p>

<p>Practice varies greatly as to the amount of material provided by the
school. Some schools require the pupils to furnish their own instruments,
as well as paper and other supplies. The advisability of
requiring much or little will have to be determined by the social conditions
of the community it is intended to serve.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
